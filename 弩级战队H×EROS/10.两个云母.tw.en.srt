1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,500
Hurry up!

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,540
I'm starving.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,300
Hurry up, quickly!

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,630
No more sleep!

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,890
Sorry.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,480
Hurry up and get breakfast.

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,320
It's already noon.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,230
I have helped you to prepare XERO battle suit for you.

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,230
But you treat me like this.

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,650
I'm really sorry.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,960
I really expect the reaction from Retto after he came back.

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,700
Stop talking. I would like to eat.

13
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,100
SUPER HXEROS

14
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,840
Episode 10 "Two Kiraras"

15
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,560
Then, let's go, guys.

16
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,960
Since being a hero,

17
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,440
when in Tokyo, you really need to visit this street.

18
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,150
I feel the same.

19
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,660
I think Ginkgo seems to be in high mood.

20
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,560
Is she familiar with Akihabara?

21
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,000
It seems to be.

22
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,710
Let's go.

23
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,220
Where shall we go first？

24
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,510
Wait a moment.

25
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,990
Although We're here for sightseeing

26
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,180
if so many of us hangs around.

27
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,600
It's not only inconvenient, but also is a shame, isn't it?

28
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,600
So shall we split into two groups?

29
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,660
It's reasonable.

30
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,100
Let's make it four and five.

31
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,310
In this case,

32
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,490
let the person with high H value

33
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,440
to choose which group they like to join.

34
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,610
Rejecting!

35
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,660
I don't want to say such a shameful thing,

36
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,830
I'm also embarrassed.

37
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,910
Decide with rock and paper (play finger guesing if no scissors)

38
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,580
Group with it!

39
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,130
So,

40
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,840
let's show the three people around.

41
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,010
See you later!

42
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,220
Then leave these two to us!

43
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,470
Why is Moeno as the captain?

44
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,820
Because of you,

45
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,100
I'm in a different group with Enjo.

46
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,810
You're annoying!

47
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,170
It's all your fault to propose group action.

48
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,050
See!

49
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,540
You don't think it's a big loss in your own mind.

50
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,620
I don't know what you are talking about.

51
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,150
When did the two become so close?

52
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,280
Thanks to this, finally we can together to have a good chat, Bai.

53
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,920
I don't feel so happy.

54
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,630
So where shall we go now?

55
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,950
A place where you will be happy, Bai.

56
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,810
Then I'll look forward to it.

57
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,730
I'm wondering where the other group is going.

58
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,100
Me too!

59
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,870
So cute!

60
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,030
I don't expect to be able to

61
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,290
interact with real owls so close in Tokyo.

62
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,940
While cat cafes and maid tea shops are fine.

63
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,720
The shop few aficionados know.

64
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,870
It's also a reminder of this street.

65
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,800
Anyway,

66
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,050
Owls also have all kinds of expressions,

67
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,010
and their sounds are so quiet. I feel so healing.

68
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,320
Let's see.

69
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,260
This owl looks like Master.

70
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,320
Is that so?

71
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,000
The one next looks like Hoshino!

72
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,880
Show it to Hoshino when we get back.

73
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,480
You two are very close!

74
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,300
Enjo and Hoshino

75
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,160
are not really so close.

76
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,280
I mean those kids.

77
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,740
That's it.

78
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,730
If I heard you correctly.

79
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,790
I came with you when you said you were going to hero's shop.

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,550
Where does the H go?

81
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,930
And those underage can't come to this kind of shops.

82
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,930
Don't worry Kirara !

83
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,160
The first floor only sells some trick toys.

84
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,170
It's on the second floor selling adult goods!

85
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,420
That is to say!

86
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,240
Le me ask whether Kirara get one too

87
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,900
Just in case.

88
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,610
Don't ne so close to me with that!

89
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,590
I'm gonna go out and have some fresh air.

90
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,490
She runs away.

91
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,790
So embarrassed.

92
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,420
What's up?

93
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,640
Cong Yu, what are you doing?

94
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,010
He is so pure.

95
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,260
Thank you for being HXEROS.

96
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,280
I've been watching your interaction.

97
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,580
Relationship between you and Enjo Retto do not seem to have changed?

98
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,230
So what if it is.

99
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,810
Sure enough.

100
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,150
I have made up my mind, Hoshino Kirara.

101
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,990
This time I will definitely capture Enjo Retto's heart.

102
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,980
Then I have something to do next,

103
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,950
So, I'm going back first.

104
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,950
And don't be too careless!

105
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,420
Except us,

106
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,370
maybe someone else is also interested in the guy.

107
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,970
Am I in a crisis now?

108
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,070
Where are you? Sora

109
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,600
Maihima, this way.

110
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,440
There is such a place like this in Akihabara!

111
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,060
I'm here for the first time too.

112
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,230
This is interesting.

113
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,910
It's "VR heroine"!

114
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,370
Are you interested in it?

115
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,990
It's Ginkgo.

116
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:43,750
The VR game is set to ask a childhood friend who lives next door to teach him to read.

117
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,500
A childhood friend

118
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,510
The game is very realistic.

119
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,300
It's a rare chance, just play around!

120
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,560
Then, I'll try.

121
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,270
What do you see Enjo?

122
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,180
Classroom... and the girl just now.

123
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,170
There seems to be no problem

124
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,780
In fact,

125
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,050
the study of the game is only the appearance

126
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,360
and the focus is on being able to kiss girls.

127
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,650
He's not just content with VR.

128
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,790
In recent VR games,

129
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,330
is even the touch feeling so realistic?

130
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,130
It is as if someone is actually just there.

131
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,040
Wait... Enjo

132
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,510
What shall I do?

133
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,720
If it does turn out that way.

134
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,220
It's amazing!

135
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,510
As if a girl is really there in front of my eyes.

136
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,010
What the hell am I doing?

137
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,480
I'm just like a freak!

138
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,480
The feeling is good!

139
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,680
Exactly.

140
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,780
That's where my H energy comes from.

141
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,410
I'm a top student at school or at home.

142
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,200
When I'm tired of this life,

143
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,520
I was invited to join HXEROS.

144
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,110
But,

145
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,710
because other players are all that virtue,

146
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,880
I'm always busy managing them in the end.

147
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,340
And my source of H energy is...

148
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,360
"Moral violation"

149
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,970
There seemed to be a strange sound just now.

150
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,330
What's up?

151
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:23,930
Ginkgo,

152
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,050
there's a reason for that.

153
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,860
Please don't tell others about what just happened.

154
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,360
Please!

155
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,110
Please! ?

156
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,280
Um...

157
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,180
I already have someone else I like,

158
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,530
so please don't do it even as a joke.

159
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,000
Do you misunderstand Enjo.

160
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,740
I don't have such feelings for you.

161
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,510
Is this to say

162
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,540
Wouldn't the members of the Saitama branch do such a thing?

163
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,540
Clearly.

164
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,390
I was cheated.

165
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,690
Cong Yu told me other branches relied on this to store H energy.

166
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,140
It's impossible.

167
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,700
Really sorry!

168
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,980
I didn't mean that,

169
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,670
I probably knew the whole story.

170
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,750
But

171
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,190
Saitama branch is really amazing.

172
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,820
what shall I say, is it serious or pure?

173
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,940
Even if you don't do that.

174
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,160
It's also top-level in terms of Kisei Chuu.

175
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,680
In normal person's eyes,

176
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,710
Our Tokyo branch shall feel strange.

177
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,250
I don't feel that way.

178
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,040
No hero cares what others think when he fights.

179
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,420
Thank you!

180
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,000
Hearing you say that,

181
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,260
I don't feel so embarrassed anymore.

182
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,930
I really admire the girl you like.

183
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:51,810
So,

184
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,190
thank you so much today.

185
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,820
It's me that need to say thank you!

186
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,070
Sorry!

187
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,910
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, you guys go first.

188
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
I see.

189
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,540
If we get separated, we'll go first.

190
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,040
What is she talking about?

191
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,250
How could it be so simple...

192
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,520
Oh, no. I'm lost.

193
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,510
Now I have no rights to laugh at the Orange Horse.

194
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,800
Enjo,

195
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,980
where are Taoyuan and others?

196
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,860
I get separated from them because of the crowd.

197
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,480
So you're just like me?

198
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,200
Shall we go back together?

199
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,850
Shoot with great accuracy.

200
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,080
I really admire the girl you like.

201
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,160
This time I definitely to capture Enjo Retto's heart!

202
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,500
We need to get something to talk...

203
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,840
Right.

204
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,300
We went to the Owl Cafe today,

205
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,470
and saw an owl looking like Hoshino.

206
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,100
I have pictures, do you want to have a sight?

207
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,430
It's cute.

208
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,870
But I like the one next.

209
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,320
I always feel this one just like someone else.

210
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,900
Right,

211
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,820
where did you go today, Hoshino?

212
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:22,990
Me?

213
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,320
Actually didn't go to any interesting places.

214
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,870
Though you said that, you still bought something.

215
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,610
This is something had been forgotten by the Tokyo branch.

216
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,290
The train is about to depart.

217
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,170
Passengers, please wait for a moment.

218
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,150
Okay, we need to change here.

219
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,740
Sorry,

220
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,260
we need to get off.

221
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,760
It was dangerous just now.

222
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,930
Fortunately you noticed.

223
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,510
Why is your hairpin missing, Hoshino?

224
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,190
Did it fall when you hit someone just now?

225
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,730
But what can I do?

226
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:06,280
I'll ask the station staff to look for it at the terminal.

227
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,120
Don't need to do this.

228
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,990
Anyway, just buy another one.

229
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,080
When did I start wearing that hairpin.

230
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,170
Obviously wear it every day.

231
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,130
I can't remember.

232
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,180
It feels like that the hairpin is a very important thing.

233
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,270
Finally found it.

234
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,890
Thank you very much.

235
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,150
It's great to have found it!

236
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,030
If it's a present from boyfriend,

237
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,480
that will be terrible.

238
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,650
This is not the case.

239
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,990
Sorry for saying such strange words.

240
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,580
It's late.

241
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,580
Do you want to contact your parents first?

242
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,080
No, it's okay.

243
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,990
Like this time,

244
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:02,170
as a man, you need to know how to guide each other.

245
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,130
Next

246
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,250
The final train has passed.

247
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,890
I think it's better to contact Uncle and ask him to pick us up.

248
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,140
That's right.

249
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,990
Um, Enjo.

250
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,410
What do you know about my hairpin/.

251
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,240
I have a vague memory of when I was attacked by Kisei Chuu.

252
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,590
I can't remember when I wore it.

253
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,170
If you hide something from me, please tell me!

254
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,470
It's not a big deal.

255
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,520
And since you don't remember.

256
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,320
Maybe it's a memory you don't like to recall!

257
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,680
I think,

258
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,480
just ask Black Kirara and she'll probably know.

259
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:02,770
But why?

260
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,980
I feel it is not a good idea.

261
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,480
So,

262
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,780
please, tell me!

263
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,530
I know.

264
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,160
But don't tell anyone,

265
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,830
especially Taoyuan.

266
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,920
It's embarrassing to mention this now.

267
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,770
I actually gave you that hairpin.

268
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,640
You're a liar.

269
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,220
But what does this have something to do with Kisei Chuu?

270
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,480
I'm afraid.

271
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,400
It was the marriage proposal promise that I gave you.

272
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,980
Morning Retto!

273
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,530
Morning Hoshino!

274
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,990
It was hot last night!

275
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,280
See,

276
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,490
I wore thin clothes when I slept, and even this place was bitten by mosquitoes.

277
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,510
Fool!

278
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,570
Don't expose that on the way to school.

279
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,120
Didn't I show it to you on the way to school?

280
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,400
It's so noisy.

281
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,330
Where do you think was bitten?

282
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,340
Do not know!

283
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,970
I can't stand this guy!

284
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,550
He always like to play tricks on others,

285
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,260
and he is headstrong and arrogant.

286
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,560
But I still like this Hoshino.

287
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,690
Today is his birthday,

288
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,610
I need to master dominance this time.

289
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,980
Bye!

290
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,030
What's the matter, Retto?

291
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,290
You call me to this place.

292
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,180
And the letter is...

293
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,890
I want to propose to you. I'll wait for you at the back of the gym after school.

294
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,170
Are you serious?

295
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,710
Yes!

296
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,630
The plan is very smooth.

297
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,420
Yes.

298
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,490
Although at first glance, it says "marriage" above,

299
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,650
but it's actually wrote "Duel".

300
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:01,100
That's how you look at me!

301
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,480
I wrote "duel" above.

302
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,650
Do you have any misunderstanding?

303
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,890
No!

304
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,450
Then I turned and made fun of Hoshino, he mistakes the word for marriage.

305
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,730
It's a perfect operation.

306
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:15,870
Come on!

307
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,660
Make fun of me as usual, Hoshino.

308
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:23,160
Since Retto said so.

309
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,080
Nothing but,

310
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:30,600
I think the marriage contract may be a little too early for our age.

311
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,880
So...

312
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,220
It's strange, what's going on in such atmosphere?

313
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,340
It's different from what I thought.

314
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,300
But according to her personality,

315
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,770
it is not the end.

316
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,140
She must be up to something.

317
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,660
Right.

318
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,560
Today is your birthday!

319
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,930
This is for you.

320
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,650
Don't wear until you have made your decision.

321
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,050
At this point, it's time for you to provoke me!

322
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,240
Come, show your nature, Hoshino!

323
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,170
Thank you. I'll cherish it.

324
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,300
I lost. Hoshino

325
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,340
So it is

326
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,470
Aren't you a little disappointed.

327
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,430
So noisy!

328
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,230
Anyway, how is this a proposal?

329
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,150
Because of your reaction.

330
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,650
A while after we encountered Kisei Chuu.

331
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,610
I saw you wearing the hairpin.

332
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,780
I was going to ask you to leave school with me.

333
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,450
As a joke, please leave it on your strange surname.

334
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,120
How can it be...

335
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,720
At that time, I didn't know why I was suddenly hated by you.

336
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,690
I see. You forgot.

337
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:57,840
It dose not expect.

338
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,770
The memory of the gift disappeared with Kisei Chuu.

339
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,640
Have I bought this hairpin?

340
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,140
Forget it.

341
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,850
It's cute, just wear it!

342
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,730
That means.

343
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,860
I have been,

344
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:18,010
always interact with Enjo under the situation of accepting the engagement?

345
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,320
Like that time...

346
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,410
I feel so humiliated and want to go away immediately.

347
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,070
Why are you so anxious?

348
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,660
He has obviously seen the more embarrassing side before.

349
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,040
It's your fault.

350
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,080
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

351
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,350
And after reading the letter, I immediately agreed.

352
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,300
I didn't know you are so innocent.

353
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,430
The other side, I have become very good at talking back now.

354
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,730
What was that?

355
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,170
Could it be Kisei Chuu?

356
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,940
No, I guess it's a cat or something.

357
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,860
Is there a cat type?

358
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,650
No. I'm not talking about Kisei Chuu.

359
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,340
Civet cat! ?

360
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,250
How could it appear in such place

361
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,620
No. It's a raccoon.

362
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,680
It's so cute!

363
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,230
Come here, good boy!

364
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,980
It's dangerous.

365
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,560
It ran away.

366
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,490
I didn't see anything.

367
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,170
It's not like this.

368
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,330
I just said.

369
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,530
This is what Cong Yu forgot to take.

370
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,220
I plan to return it to her next time.

371
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,990
If that's really the case.

372
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,560
Then you can just leave it to Ruocao?

373
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,170
You're right.

374
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,850
But that's not bad.

375
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,840
This means Hoshino finally has the consciousness of being a hero.

376
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,640
Don't draw conclusions.

377
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,600
I'm just joking.

378
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,250
You're so serious now...

379
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,190
So I told you,

380
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,310
take it!

381
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,080
I borrow you the coat, take it and put it on.

382
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,130
As if she goes away.

383
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,810
Sorry to push you down.

384
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,260
No. Thanks to that. I was finally saved.

385
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,010
Even though it was a desperate move,

386
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,600
I would have done it of my own accord.

387
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,920
After hearing what Enjo just said

388
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,740
Am I swayed?

389
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,730
Since being attacked by Kisei Chuu,

390
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,360
I do not want to experience the feeling of humiliation,

391
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,820
so I choose to stay away from guys.

392
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,450
Isn't it the same as before?

393
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,200
But if,

394
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,490
I didn't meet Kisei Chuu.

395
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,500
Right.

396
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,840
As you just said,

397
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,830
I don't seem to give you a clear answer yet.

398
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,630
No, after all, I was just young at that time.

399
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,840
Let it go！

400
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,550
But like this。

401
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:30,140
Am I just like a useless person who can't even answer a confession?

402
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,890
Is that right?

403
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,390
So what if.

404
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,690
Our relationship can be restored to what it was before we met Kisei Chuu.

405
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,230
If we can successfully wipe out all Kisei Chuus,

406
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,280
I will answer you at that time.

407
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,610
But,

408
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,420
if you dare to change your mind to others.

409
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,530
I will not forgive you.

410
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,370
What is the situation?

411
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,090
Could it be that...

412
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,670
Slowly, I need to calm down.

413
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,080
It can't be happening.

414
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,990
Anyway,

415
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,670
I need to contact Uncle first.

416
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,680
The number you dailed cannot be connected.

417
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,390
Uncle's cell phone is out of charge.

418
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,010
What shall I do?

419
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,650
There's no solution.

420
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,420
Like this time,

421
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,570
as a man, you needs to know how to guide each other.

422
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,780
Let's go back by taxi.

423
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,140
SUPER HXEROS

424
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,660
Next Words "Goodbye HXEROS"
