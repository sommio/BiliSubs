1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,570
Retto, do you know?

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,550
The way adults shake hands

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:09,870
I don't know

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,490
Then lend me your hand

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,850
No

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,590
It looks like this

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,750
It's the way adult couples shake hands.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,050
Hoshino?

9
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,860
I... I know

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,470
Don't hold it

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,810
There is nothing to be ashamed of, Retto

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,810
It's just a practice

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,860
What are you talking about…practice

14
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,740
Don't tell you

15
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,740
What the hell

16
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,480
That day

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,530
For the first time in my life

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,500
Hope to be a HERO

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,350
Now, five years later

20
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,350
SUPER HXEROS

21
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,730
The first chapter "in a bright world"

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,610
How do you think about, Retto

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,930
What do you want to ask, Date

24
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,640
I mean, the turmoil

25
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,810
Turmoil?

26
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,130
It is the rumor that there's an alien, a weirdo.

27
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,520
Or something strange, who knows

28
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,390
If it is true, it would be interesting, right

29
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,480
Torigoe, which girl do you like

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,120
I'd like to pick this girl

31
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,740
Ask me questions and even ignore me

32
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,530
How about you, Retto

33
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,620
I... Forget it

34
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,580
What

35
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,870
You're really tactless, every time

36
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,670
I mean you did such a thing at school …

37
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,560
Eww

38
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,920
Why are boys always being like that

39
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,520
That's really terrible

40
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,300
Enough is enough

41
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,810
Don’t you know other girls can’t stand you?

42
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,820
If you want to talk dirty

43
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,140
Go to the toilet

44
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,460
Hoshino …

45
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,970
You really are "Iron maiden" Hoshino Mica

46
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,940
an ultra-cleanliness who won't touch anything that boy has touched

47
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,480
let alone a boy

48
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,880
Even though, because she is very beautiful

49
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,010
The boys who threw themselves at her were everywhere.

50
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,090
Your childhood friend is this kind of person. I think you have no hope, Retto.

51
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,270
Yes …

52
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,810
Anyway, Kirara has really changed

53
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,930
She used to play with boys more often .

54
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,480
She must have suffered from those flirting boys.

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,320
True

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,690
One day, Hoshino suddenly totally changed

57
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,820
She used to have a very active personality

58
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,490
We often went to other places together.

59
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,090
Although she often played tricks on me.

60
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,050
I like that Hoshino

61
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,480
Hoshino

62
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,470
Are you on duty today

63
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,370
Can you help me carry some books to the office

64
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,190
I see

65
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,450
See you so reluctant, need help?

66
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,520
Anyway, I see you …

67
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,780
don't want to touch things touched by boys.

68
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,510
Enjo

69
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,310
If you want to carry, just carry

70
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,440
Let me speak frankly

71
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,070
You are not allowed to reach half a meter of mine.

72
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,410
Yes, yes, yes

73
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,780
She is the same

74
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,580
I mean

75
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,460
You don't have to pay too much attention to other people's eyes.

76
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,210
Even if you change more

77
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,290
Hoshino is Hoshino

78
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,190
Just like before

79
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,450
What do you mean

80
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,950
As if I were urging myself to change.

81
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,470
No, I don't mean that

82
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,670
What else does that mean

83
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,190
Let me clarify

84
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,940
I am not different from before in my view.

85
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,400
You know nothing about me

86
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,450
Don't act like you know me very well just because we are childhood friends.

87
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,650
If you're doing me a favor just to talk about this nonsense

88
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,950
Then I don't need you

89
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,000
Danger

90
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,560
Sorry, Hoshino

91
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,230
It was only when I was in a hurry that I …

92
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,190
I really didn't mean it

93
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,860
Hoshi... Hoshino

94
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,590
What the hell?

95
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,920
The reason why Hoshino changed

96
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,550
It's my secret with her

97
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,300
The reason is that …

98
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,560
Although the show is only halfway through.

99
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,390
Here's your news flash

100
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,520
A strange man suddenly came out of Saitama City.

101
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,320
The strange people "Kisei Chuu" that began to show five years ago

102
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,200
made the streets into a mess.

103
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,740
Doctor, please explain

104
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,900
Let me said straightforwardly

105
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,450
The Kisei Chuu is not strange people.

106
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,670
They were aliens who invaded the earth years ago.

107
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,960
They removed things that make people feel pornographic.

108
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,020
To absorb people's Pornographic Energy

109
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,630
That is, "H Energy"

110
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,800
They will not hesitate to use all means.

111
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,950
Go down further

112
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,400
Childlessness is getting heavier and heavier.

113
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,220
People go to death in fear.

114
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,310
Please calm down, Doctor

115
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,750
In a word

116
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,000
If human H energy is sucked away,

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,240
It is very dangerous to lose the vitality of life.

118
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,500
Everybody, stay away from the Kisei Chuu

119
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,330
Thank you all for coming today

120
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,830
I will try my best to perform

121
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,820
Dropping the cram school is the right choice. -We will cheer you up.

122
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,630
Thank you for cheering me on

123
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,420
It seems that a puppet lady has arrived.

124
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,880
Please kindly advise

125
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,160
Kisei Chuu "Hakkou Chuu"

126
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,930
Large Numbers of males flock together for a small number of females.

127
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,720
Man is really a creature with no reason

128
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,920
The first song was …

129
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,450
Did you see it

130
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,370
But it seems to be light?

131
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,920
Did you take a picture

132
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Sure

133
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,320
This year, I will take an examination, and I wonder what the hell I am doing.

134
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,460
I have to go to the company soon...

135
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,760
What's wrong with everyone

136
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,350
Meimaolin's Secret New …

137
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,580
I'd better find a job,

138
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,900
Once pornography is taken away from humans, it’s only that level.

139
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,200
Looks like there's one left

140
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,360
Just like that one

141
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,330
How many people have you took away his feelings so far

142
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,640
I will never …

143
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,800
Let you do what you want

144
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,560
It's just a human, don't talk big

145
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,690
Why don't I just suck up your H energy

146
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,310
The fragrant H energy in puberty

147
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,220
is my favourite

148
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,570
Really

149
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,900
But before that

150
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,370
Let's try my trick first

151
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,620
The reason why Hoshino being like that

152
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:28,990
It's all …

153
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,330
Caused by Kisei Chuu

154
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,250
How is it possible

155
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,050
I can't believe that I'm going to lose to a human

156
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,610
Is this guy...

157
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,330
I'm committed to killing the Kisei Chuu…

158
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,630
High school student and HERO

159
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,980
"Hakkou Chuu"

160
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:09,040
Saitama Branch of Guardians of the Earth

161
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,925
HERO Department of Saitama Branch of Guardians of the Earth

162
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:13,050
Please do something about it

163
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,110
This is the kind of design that would explode if you beat Kisei Chuu

164
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,960
Every time I have to take my clothes to change, Oh, crap.

165
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,600
There is no other way, bro Retto.

166
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,910
It turns out that "XERO GEAR" can only strengthen your body.

167
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,240
Even if it is

168
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,060
The least you can do is think about me who has to run naked in the street every time

169
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,720
Anyway

170
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,880
Is such a thing worth being so embarrassed about

171
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,370
I think your clothes are embarrassing enough

172
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,860
Really

173
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,410
All right

174
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,880
After that, bro Retto

175
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:58,940
Thank you

176
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,220
By the way

177
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,660
What's going on about adding new members

178
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,880
I am looking for it

179
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,260
It's just that I can't find anyone like you.

180
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,070
Uncle, why don't you just do it yourself.

181
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,830
Don't impose on others

182
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,520
The XERO GEAR

183
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,530
can turn user's Pornographic energy

184
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,030
"H Energy" into its own power

185
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,160
Only you adolescent girls and boys use it

186
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,260
can achieve the greatest effect

187
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,830
Not like me, the old uncle

188
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,300
what's more …

189
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,330
You can't change the girl's Kisei Chuu

190
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,050
Yes

191
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,180
That's why I agreed to help

192
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,300
I also know that even if I do these things

193
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,510
The Hoshino in the past is no longer able to return.

194
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,740
But

195
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,720
I've made up my mind

196
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,420
I won't let anyone experience this feeling again

197
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,740
Even if that guy denied everything

198
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,280
For me, it was also a memory of my first love that could never be replaced

199
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,300
Tomorrow I will apologize to her formally.

200
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,890
Hoshino

201
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,290
I'm really sorry about yesterday

202
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,350
Hoshino

203
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,320
It's all my fault

204
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,440
Stinky boy, why are you staring at me

205
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,730
nothing …

206
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,050
Well …

207
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:44,940
Good morning

208
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,620
Morning, Kirara

209
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,860
Have you finished your language homework

210
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,070
Of course

211
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,490
But you can't copy it

212
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,210
My existence has disappeared from Hoshino's mind

213
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,480
Hoshi... Hoshino?

214
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,420
Hoshino

215
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,760
Hoshino …

216
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,970
People in the past said

217
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,360
The opposite of "like" is not "dislike"

218
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,120
But "being indifferent"

219
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,860
Well... Well, I know

220
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,950
You don't have to answer me

221
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,590
It doesn't matter if you don't want to forgive me

222
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,590
But please listen to me

223
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,290
Has Hoshino changed

224
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,610
It doesn't matter at all

225
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,090
Even if you don't want to look back

226
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,210
The past is also the same.

227
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:44,720
I actually

228
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,690
… to Hoshino at that time

229
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,070
Found you, human

230
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,550
You were yesterday …

231
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,880
Don't worry, Hoshino

232
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,280
You can back off first

233
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,080
Come forth, Kisei Chuu

234
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,420
I won't let you hit Hoshino again

235
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,660
Enjo

236
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,580
After the exhaustion of yesterday's battle

237
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,320
H-Energy is not enough, right?

238
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,960
You don't seem to be able to exert the power like yesterday

239
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,170
In that case

240
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,420
I shall now use the new body that her Majesty has given me

241
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,880
to go to the streets and absorb all H-energy.

242
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,390
Just grind your teeth and watch

243
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,810
The first step

244
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,950
I will absorb the female H-energy behind you.

245
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,910
What is it

246
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,100
Run, Hoshino

247
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,390
What is the feeling

248
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,630
Now it's an emergency

249
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,390
But I feel …

250
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,430
Enjo, your hand …

251
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,100
Sorry, I'm...

252
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,080
No

253
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,980
Only this one time

254
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,450
Take my hand anyway

255
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,840
This feeling

256
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,350
I haven't felt this way for many years

257
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,920
The Hand of Enjo

258
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,640
It's bigger than I thought

259
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,270
It's very heavy to hold it.

260
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,140
Body temperature passes through his hand

261
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,520
Boy's Hand

262
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,940
Is that how it feels

263
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,360
Because they have been connected before.

264
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,520
Now I become very sensitive to boys

265
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,670
But

266
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,810
Like hands connected directly

267
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,890
In some ways, it's not just a matter of holding the naked body together.

268
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,570
I can't stand it anymore

269
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,390
The sealed atrium will be opened.

270
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,820
What's going on

271
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,270
I've never seen anything like it

272
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,210
Is it the H-energy source of Hoshino?

273
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,610
I found you

274
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,580
Wake up, human

275
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,490
It's getting bigger

276
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,110
She put all the people in the street...

277
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,850
How to deal with this guy

278
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,040
I'll tell you the reason later.

279
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,300
Anyway, let's work together now

280
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,030
Break her down

281
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,460
You're awesome, Hoshino

282
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,940
Hit the large-scale Kisei Chuu by a blow...

283
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,700
No!

284
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,100
What the hell is it

285
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,590
Sorry... I got you involved in this

286
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,730
But

287
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,730
It's really a great deal to have you here.

288
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,820
Really

289
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,490
Has he been fighting somewhere I don't know

290
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,580
with the monsters that attacked us…

291
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,880
you OK?

292
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,750
What did that guy do to you just now

293
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,720
I'm OK

294
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,820
Just a little bit of a shock

295
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,090
Impossible

296
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,630
I sucked up so much H-energy and I was able to act like nothing had happened

297
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,100
How could there be such a pornographic human

298
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,130
This quantity is several times…tens of times as many as the average person

299
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,130
No, even more

300
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,150
What does she usually think

301
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,160
so that she could have such an extraordinary degree of pornography

302
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,700
I actually have no way to suck her H-energy dry.

303
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,470
this people…

304
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,990
is out of control

305
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,470
Hoshino

306
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,690
There is no such thing

307
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,670
It's my heart closed

308
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,620
Began to refuse contact with men

309
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,930
But if …

310
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,920
I can go back to the old time…

311
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:46,100
In that case…

312
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,140
Let me be do a favor for Retto

313
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,380
But only if you promise me

314
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,670
Don't tell anyone about what happened today

315
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,750
Don't talk about this yet, Hoshino

316
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,360
You call me Retto …

317
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,520
Nope

318
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,160
I'm sorry. You forgot about it

319
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,130
But you just …

320
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,600
Enjo …

321
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,610
You heard me wrong, didn't you

322
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:29,680
Yes …

323
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,550
Why make out

324
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,270
with someone naked in a public place like this

325
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,370
You …

326
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,880
Honestly

327
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,090
we heard that a large Kisei Chuu appeared

328
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,860
so we come here to help

329
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,250
Is this girl YELLOW

330
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,010
It is YELLOW

331
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,250
It's more like "Super YELLOW"

332
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,730
It's a rude thing to say about people you meet for the first time, Momoka

333
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,720
What's the matter with these people

334
00:20:59,290 --> 00:20:59,800
Take it

335
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,940
Put it on while nobody come here.

336
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,020
Thank you

337
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,440
Well, this is the key

338
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,770
