1
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:04,790
Retto

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,920
Tenkuzi Zora, where are your change of clothing

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,130
Don't talk about this yet, Kirara...

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,630
Kirara was …

5
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,000
SUPER HXEROS

6
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,190
Episode 5 "HXEROS. RISING"

7
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,200
Sorry, everyone

8
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,660
Sora was right there with her.

9
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,490
Tenkuzi Zora... It's not your fault

10
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,200
No one could have predicted that Kisei Chuu would utilize to this tactic

11
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,250
That's true

12
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,170
And we are all very worried about Hoshino san

13
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,030
Right? Momoka

14
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,780
It's... Yeah

15
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,900
What's wrong with you, Taoyuan

16
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,170
Nothing

17
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,640
No

18
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,230
We can't fight in this situation

19
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,980
Everyone

20
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,440
Do you think it would be easy to save her

21
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,740
at their request

22
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,780
It might be a trap

23
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,950
Is it better to save more H energy just in case?

24
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,990
Make sense

25
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,540
But how

26
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,390
Count on me

27
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,340
Retto, wait for us there first

28
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,680
Are you serious

29
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,060
There should be only Momoka

30
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,420
saves H energy by this way

31
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,280
You …

32
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,320
Why did you say such disheartening words

33
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,370
To save our partners

34
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,820
We heroes surely have to be fully prepared

35
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,490
I see

36
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,660
And I also understand

37
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,520
What are you doing in this condition?

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,340
Emm Enjo san…

39
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,710
Well…

40
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,180
Is it OK? Retto

41
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,580
Accumulating H energy in a state where we can be exposed

42
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,140
and be seen by Retto at any time

43
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,690
This is called a win-win relationship

44
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,460
You're the only one who wins

45
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,400
What

46
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,710
Did he find out that I was trying so hard to store H energy

47
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,860
then it all exploded

48
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,800
What

49
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,510
Isn't that a pity

50
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,900
Come on, let's go

51
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,720
What's more

52
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,700
If you are in danger, tell me.

53
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,390
If you don't mind

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,430
I can at least protect you

55
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,350
Enjo

56
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,690
Retto

57
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,060
You don't have to put on a brave face

58
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,390
Just said you want to protect them,

59
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,360
but now the situation is really …

60
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,130
You are also a human being, aren't you

61
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,040
Why do you help Kisei Chuu

62
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,510
When did I say I was human

63
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,690
This is called mimicry

64
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,490
We Kisei Chuu

65
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,870
will change our appearance to match the planet's ecosystem

66
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,290
Some of them were mixed into the people's society

67
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,040
who control things from the inside

68
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,520
But it’s too late to know this

69
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,720
How

70
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,830
I am going to report directly to Her Majesty the Queen.

71
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,930
Take a good look at her

72
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,460
I see

73
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,560
I have to think of the method to escape.

74
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,610
If you can use XERO GEAR now...

75
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,600
By the way

76
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,520
That lady

77
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,110
If I start saving H energy, you will be very vexed, aren't you

78
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,880
I’m tied up like this now, energy starts to accumulate slowly

79
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,820
Is that really good?

80
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,040
Human beings are so annoying

81
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,030
Really

82
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,880
Don't force me to do such a thing

83
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,190
From XERO GEAR’s reaction

84
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,780
It's around here

85
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,160
Is that OK?

86
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,780
Not bad

87
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,290
That's great

88
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,870
No one seems to be here

89
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,610
Human being?

90
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,720
What to do next?

91
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,660
It's a human being

92
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,390
It's really soft

93
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,800
Sorry

94
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,740
It was the first time I saw human being

95
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,820
Can't help to...

96
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,200
What the hell is going on?

97
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,030
Is it really Kisei Chuu?

98
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,320
What the hell are you

99
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,250
Are you the companion of Kisei Chuu?

100
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,510
My name is Tya Tya

101
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,530
I am the first daughter of Her Majesty the Queen

102
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,460
That is to say, I'm the princess

103
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,880
Just

104
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,340
Because I am the forbidden child born once in a thousand years.

105
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,900
Have been locked here since birth

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,640
Therefore, calling me companion is not strictly true.

107
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,740
You said you were locked here

108
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,680
But aren't you all Kisei Chuu

109
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,770
Unfortunately, they don't seem to think so

110
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,570
As you can see, I am a mutant in a race

111
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,360
I'm afraid the reason why I was locked

112
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,120
is because I have the exact opposite constitution to other compatriots

113
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,720
Well

114
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,720
I think you're a good human female

115
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,290
I have a favor to ask of you

116
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,810
My name is Kirara

117
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,250
Would you please take me out of here?

118
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,740
This planet is interesting

119
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,470
The mating behavior of the dominant species

120
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,380
is obviously so complicated compared to other races

121
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,100
But it can be so prosperous

122
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,330
Especially

123
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,520
I really like the show in this country called "Lunch Theater"

124
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,690
You really know it

125
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,290
I think you know it too

126
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,490
My countrymen intend to let human perish

127
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,780
I wish I could prevent this from happening anyway

128
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,850
I will not ask you to forgive my countrymen for what they have done

129
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,660
But I hope you can help me

130
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,510
I see

131
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,530
Because I want to get out of here just like you do

132
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,020
Is it here?

133
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,020
How should we attack

134
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,320
Now it can only break through from the front, right?

135
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,450
Yes

136
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,800
With so much energy stored,

137
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,990
we girls have to make a scene

138
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,660
Then I'll go first

139
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,500
There may be some Kisei Chuu

140
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,400
But…

141
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,760
I'll leave it to you

142
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,510
Yeah

143
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,210
We need to rescue Hoshino san quickly

144
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,840
We must go home together

145
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,920
But I didn't expect that

146
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,560
You could be knocked unconscious by a human

147
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,270
You're so noisy

148
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,140
I was just careless

149
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,000
Get out

150
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,490
How can you go

151
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,580
"Lamaze Cannon"

152
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,720
The Light of the Sky

153
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,930
What the hell

154
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,090
Leave a few for me to fight

155
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,100
Now is not the time for such jokes

156
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,560
Next

157
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,610
What will happen if they dare to attack our important friends

158
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,650
We must let Kisei Chuu know that

159
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,660
A bow annoying kill

160
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,670
"Crazy Peony"

161
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,010
Wait for me, Hoshino

162
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,340
Mimicry Mimicry…

163
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,680
I'm Mimicry Chuu

164
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,340
So it is

165
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,940
That is, the Kirara only need to save H energy

166
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,480
Then she can have a very strong force

167
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,370
That's it

168
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,480
Then，leave it to me.

169
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,080
I just said

170
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,780
I am a mutant who have the exact opposite constitution to other compatriots

171
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:53,750
I can release the pheromones that make other races easy to feel H energy

172
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,920
What's that …

173
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,050
So let me supply you with H energy

174
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,350
being sensitive …

175
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,270
I can't. .

176
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,040
No reaction at all

177
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,660
Kirara

178
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,990
Have you imagined the scene in your mind?

179
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,390
Which scene

180
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,370
Carry on the family line

181
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,920
What the hell are you talking about? Are you a fool?

182
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,840
Why?

183
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,410
Human beings are sexual reproduction, right?

184
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,300
Why be ashamed of the survival instinct？

185
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,510
You should be more frank to yourself

186
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,720
Well

187
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,810
Human beings have a emotion called shame

188
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,360
It seems noisy outside

189
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,680
HXEROS are at entry

190
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,170
Hurry up

191
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,480
That's …

192
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,150
What's the matter

193
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,570
Could it be that

194
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,210
everyone come to rescue me

195
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,630
Tya Tya

196
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,580
Maybe we can get out of here

197
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,080
Really

198
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,050
Can we really get out of here?

199
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,500
No way

200
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,590
No wonder I couldn't find you anywhere

201
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,180
There you are

202
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,520
It's your turn as a hostage

203
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,290
Come with me

204
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,180
No, let me go

205
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,540
Let go of Kirara, quickly

206
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,210
It turned out to be your Majesty the Princess

207
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,150
You don't want to help human being, do you

208
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,110
What if I do

209
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,890
You have never regarded me as your companion

210
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,330
Yeah, you're right

211
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,920
So-called mutant

212
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,500
will be weeded out if they can't adapt to the environment

213
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,670
It is the common sense of nature

214
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,930
Please don’t forget that the queen kept you alive only because you were the first princess

215
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,290
Princess

216
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,600
Wait for me, Tya Tya

217
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,500
I will come back to save you

218
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,490
Is this it?

219
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,820
That's it

220
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,450
Just give in

221
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,240
Hoshino

222
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,670
Otherwise…

223
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,680
Compatriots present

224
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,210
will absorb the female's H energy together

225
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,510
Until she lost the strength to live

226
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,100
Try it if you can

227
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,810
I will not give in because of it

228
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,480
Your face flushed

229
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,330
Have you already had experience？

230
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,550
Poor

231
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,940
You will never have a chance to experience it again

232
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,900
I see

233
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,660
This is the source of our power, XERO GEAR

234
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,700
Take this off and you won't be able to fight the Kisei Chuu

235
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,560
So

236
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,960
don't hit Hoshino

237
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,400
What the hell are you doing

238
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,210
Didn't you say you couldn't get over theKisei Chuu

239
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,340
Yeah

240
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,210
But the same

241
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,710
I can’t forgive myself for failing to protect Hoshino that day

242
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,010
I don't want to feel that way anymore

243
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,930
Enjo

244
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,600
And

245
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,730
I am very regretful until now

246
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,610
Why didn't I say it at that time?

247
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,980
Having a lot of H energy is not ashamed at all

248
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:53,570
No

249
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,620
Let's say I think it's good

250
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,810
Why are you still making such a joke in this condition?

251
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,040
I wasn't joking

252
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,240
I mean it

253
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,380
So get these guys down quickly

254
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,300
You should be more frank to yourself

255
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,890
Be frank …

256
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,250
I used to be that way too

257
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,860
Why did I forget all about it

258
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,450
Get wet all through

259
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,080
Look at the heavy rain

260
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,320
This year's Tanabata Festival may suspend

261
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,300
What a waste of my dressing up

262
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,210
Although I'm embarrassed to Date

263
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,670
Stay here until the rain stops

264
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,970
Retto

265
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,670
Do you know what Tanabata Lover is

266
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,060
Today the Tanabata is the same as Valentine’s Day

267
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:08,270
It's a day when girls send snacks to boys they like

268
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,820
So that's it

269
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,320
I don't even know

270
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,820
Don't talk about this yet

271
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,130
I feel a little hungry now

272
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,830
What the hell is your reaction

273
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,210
If you want it, just say it

274
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,670
Yes, I really want it

275
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,490
Sorry

276
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,790
I forgot to bring it

277
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,970
Why do you look so disappointed

278
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,390
No

279
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,680
Anyway, this culture hasn’t taken root in Japan

280
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,810
I'm not upset

281
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,350
You're acting brave again

282
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,730
In that case, if the rain stops …

283
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,400
I can also buy snacks for you at the festival

284
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,060
The rain has stopped

285
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,120
The festival may not be stopped yet (hope to be happy with my sweetheart, Kirara)

286
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,540
Yes

287
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,340
The high school life I longed for at that time

288
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,960
was not like this

289
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,470
I want to have a boyfriend and date with him after school

290
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,020
Spend the holidays together at home

291
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,550
I could have lived a more fulfilling life

292
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,870
It's all your fault

293
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,360
If it weren’t for you,

294
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,250
I might have the courage to confess

295
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,420
What about the H energy just now

296
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,470
Is that... Kirara

297
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,310
Hoshina, are you okay?

298
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,690
I'm weak now

299
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,700
Thank you, Retto

300
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,540
Then

301
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,150
I have a favor to ask of you

302
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,750
Kirara …

303
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,360
It seems that things are going well

304
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,300
In this way, I …

305
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,100
It is worth being born in the world.

306
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,370
What's going on

307
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,040
Kirara, are you OK?

308
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,680
I'm OK

309
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,500
Let's get out of here

310
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,210
Well, how about Enjo

311
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,550
That guy's gonna be fine

312
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,720
I've heard it all from Hoshino

313
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,270
Let's get out of here together

314
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,430
Tya Tya

315
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,540
Enjo

316
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,400
Retto

317
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,320
Enjo san

318
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,950
What should I do

319
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,870
It's all my fault

320
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,370
No problem

321
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,290
Retto will be fine

322
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,710
And

323
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,280
This time it is Kirara's blessing that we can get rid of all the Kisei Chuu

324
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,550
Cheer up

325
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,180
We finally defeated the Kisei Chuu

326
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,260
Somebody help me

327
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,720
The voice is … Enjo's

328
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,100
Is it the male of human

329
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,610
Different from the female, the meat is very hard

330
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,780
Another Kirara! ?

331
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,950
Calm down, everybody

332
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,700
That child is our companion as well as Kisei Chuu

333
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,870
So... What the!

334
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,630
You are

335
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,590
We defeated Kisei Chuu

336
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,650
But even if the nest is destroyed,

337
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,170
It's useless if we don't defeat the mother queen

338
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,220
Anyway

339
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,850
Humans can beat us, I really like you guys

340
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,080
