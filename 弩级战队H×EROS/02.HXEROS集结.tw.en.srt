1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,510
Retto

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,910
No, Hoshino

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,320
You can't do this in here...

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,300
Retto said

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,380
that only H-energy can defeat Kisei Chuu.

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,870
And don't get me wrong.

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,840
I'm not doing it for Retto.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,580
but for the world peace.

9
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,860
SUPER HXEROS

10
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,740
Episode 2 "HXEROS Assemble"

11
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,060
Just a dream...

12
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,170
It's you, Rumba.

13
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,380
What's this?

14
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,300
It... It's... .

15
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,740
Rumba, you can't run away from me.

16
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,960
Taoyuan

17
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,730
Give me my underwear!

18
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,820
You... what you mean, Retto?

19
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,290
No, it's Rumba. It ...

20
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,340
If you are a man, take it yourself!

21
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,670
Is that why you are mad?

22
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,130
Shit.

23
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,400
Why are the guys so chicken these days?

24
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,680
You are so noisy...

25
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,390
Tenkuji！

26
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,490
Retto

27
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,570
Why are you sleeping Sora's room?

28
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,390
I was gonna ask you this.

29
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,230
You must have walked in my room during your sleep.

30
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,520
You room is across the hallway. How many times do I have to tell you this before you can sleep in the right room?

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,160
Quite a morning, huh, Enjo?

32
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,750
Thank you, Shirayuki

33
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,210
You are the only one at home

34
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,610
who treat me as a normal person.

35
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,510
There's no such thing.

36
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,510
Everyone is good.

37
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,440
Come, Rumba.

38
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,210
Here is your breakfast.

39
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,020
It fell into a strange place.

40
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,850
Rumba... don't go in there!

41
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,480
Ah. . You saw that... That's embarrassing...

42
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,650
It's ok. I didn't see anything.

43
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,420
This place

44
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,730
is the base of the HXEROS

45
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,940
We all live together.

46
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,700
There is only one exception.

47
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,570
It's great to find someone new here.

48
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,410
So,

49
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,040
HXEROS can finally take actions!

50
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,960
I have a question.

51
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,090
We are a team. But is it necessary that we live together?

52
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,470
As HXEROS, you must be able to take action immediately anytime.

53
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,760
To defeat the enemy, cooperation between you guys is necessary.

54
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,760
But...

55
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,750
Unmo

56
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,040
Kirara

57
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,390
Don't touch me.

58
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,210
We are the same kind of people. So we will get on well with each other.

59
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,650
We are the same?

60
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,200
I don't see that at all.

61
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,160
No …

62
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,380
You are wrong. You have the same quality.

63
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,370
What do you mean by the same quality?

64
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,040
The ability to feel pornography

65
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,970
I'm gonna go!

66
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,390
I don't have time to listen to all this nonsense!

67
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,270
Wait a minute!

68
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,880
What's the matter with her?

69
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,070
What a pity!

70
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,860
She's very qualified...

71
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,070
Hey, Retto!

72
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,160
Could you please go and convince her?

73
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,450
It's impossible.

74
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,680
You saw her reaction just now.

75
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,870
Pleaaaaase

76
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,830
We need her.

77
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,210
Taoyuan

78
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,380
Because when you speak of heroes,

79
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,260
there are always five of them in a team.

80
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,960
Just for that the reason?

81
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,310
It is also very important to find all the members in our team.

82
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,120
But Hoshimo …

83
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,860
What's the matter?

84
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,430
Taran Chuu of Kisei Chuu?

85
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,370
Cosplay?

86
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,250
The shirt you are wearing is too short!

87
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,610
So what?

88
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,000
See what I can do!

89
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,550
Ahh, this is better.

90
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,290
I don't want it!

91
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,970
Enough, Kisei Chuu!

92
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,320
Thank you...

93
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:45,870
That's Strange.

94
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,580
If Hoshino fights the Kisei Chuu... .

95
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,720
That's too much!

96
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,320
Oh, no wonder...

97
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,200
yeah. .

98
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,980
Good morning~

99
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,720
It's her again. Steel virgin.

100
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,350
How on earth did she refuse him?

101
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,800
Enjo

102
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,860
Good morning.

103
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,870
I'm goona go.

104
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,540
Go. . where?

105
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,200
The locker?

106
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,530
What happened, Retto?

107
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,670
Nothing.

108
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,300
Nothing?

109
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,010
It doesn't look like nothing.

110
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,420
There gotta be something...

111
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,320
Our promise

112
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,010
Let me help you.

113
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,140
But you have to promise me first

114
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,480
that you won't tell anybody what happen today.

115
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,780
Is it because yesterday …

116
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,480
No, It's not just because of that …

117
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,090
Ah. . It's more comfortable this way...

118
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,600
Hoshino

119
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,720
Can I have a word with you?

120
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,890
Enjo

121
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,960
What's the matter?

122
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,520
You didn't tell anyone about yesterday, huh?

123
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,200
Of course not.

124
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,360
That's why I want to talk to you when you are sorting things out.

125
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,480
So you are gonna threaten me?

126
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,030
What? No!

127
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,490
Then what do you want?

128
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,820
Uncle wants me to persuade you.

129
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,120
I thought about it.

130
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,910
I think you fighting that thing that caused your emotional problem

131
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,370
is very cruel for you.

132
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,750
Of course it is.

133
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,620
But, you,

134
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,320
Why do you want to fight them no matter the costs?

135
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,140
I always thought that

136
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:19,970
if that day...

137
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,020
we didn't come across Kisei Chuu,

138
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,850
our relationship would be totally different.

139
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,860
Apart from us,

140
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,320
there are many people who had trouble with their closed ones because of Kisei Chuu.

141
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,610
No matter what the reason is,

142
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,700
we can't let it take our feelings away.

143
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,540
Enjo...

144
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,370
Even though uncle thought Hosino is very qualified and it was a pity that Hosino didn't join us,

145
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,930
I'll deal with him. Don't worry.

146
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,650
That's it.

147
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,260
Sorry to bother you.

148
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,350
Why?

149
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,820
Everybody thinks I know a lot about sex.

150
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,860
Hard to say

151
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,650
In the past, I did

152
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,380
know something about it...

153
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,390
Yeah, I am Jiko Chuu.

154
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,250
You know,

155
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,180
human heart

156
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,130
beats 3 billion times during their lifetime.

157
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,300
So I am thinking...

158
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,560
Do you wanna know whose heart beats faster?

159
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,690
Interesting.

160
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,730
I won't lose.

161
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,190
Surprise me.

162
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,930
Well... First

163
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,580
Put our hands on each other's chests.

164
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,490
No, I can't do that. This is not okay!

165
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,200
What should I do about you?

166
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,540
Well

167
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,920
This is easier for you, right?

168
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,470
Enjo Retto's heart is... beating so fast.

169
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,180
Strange.

170
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,720
This sound

171
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,520
My heart is beating as fast as his.

172
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,820
Let's call it a draw today.

173
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,400
But I have changed.

174
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,370
I'm not that girl who liked to pretend to be precocious.

175
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,840
The weirdo!

176
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,970
Weirdo?

177
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,390
Is it...

178
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,750
the creature from yesterday

179
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,010
appears in the school?

180
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,420
Other than us,

181
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,060
there are many people who had trouble with their closed ones because of Kisei Chuu.

182
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,220
Jiko Chuu of Kisei Chuu

183
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,660
Is this the so-called school?

184
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,580
It's just what I want, young people everywhere.

185
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,140
Before the guy who "took care of" my sister comes out,

186
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,920
I will play here first.

187
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,760
You're running too slowly.

188
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,370
You have just been refused by your love.

189
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,480
It seems that you have a lot of negative H energy.

190
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,120
In your mind,

191
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,750
your filthy fantasy about that girl,

192
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,520
I know it all!

193
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,650
Like making her in a swimsuit...

194
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,420
Master …

195
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,460
Can you take me for a walk, please? Woof!

196
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,550
I don't have any choice.

197
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,810
Could. . could you become my friend?

198
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,120
Having sex with a beauty until dawn in a hotel room... Downloaded

199
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,520
And...

200
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,400
Next time, can you be with me ...

201
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,950
Who give you the right to say that to me?

202
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,820
Besides, who are you?

203
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,160
I won't give my number to a person I don't know!

204
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,410
I like her so much.

205
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,090
No, I liked her so much,

206
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,340
But she said that to me …

207
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,340
Don't worry about it.

208
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,650
I will absorb all your H-energy,

209
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,350
so you won't think about it any more.

210
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,020
No... I don't want...

211
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,770
What the hell is Enjo doing?

212
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,650
If he can't get here in time,

213
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,790
But... The boy...

214
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,740
It doesn't matter what you think.

215
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,170
Stop it!

216
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,500
No matter what the reason is,

217
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,630
we can't let it take our emotions away.

218
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,010
Yes, that's right.

219
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,760
What I did to him causes what happens now.

220
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,440
I have to fix it all by myself.

221
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,810
Wait a minute

222
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,860
If you want to absorb H-energy,

223
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,020
start with me.

224
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,200
What a surprise! Before HXEROS,

225
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,370
I didn't expect to see an ordinary person to fight against me.

226
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,420
But,

227
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,120
Look, you are shaking with fear.

228
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,200
What's the point to stand out?

229
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,220
Then I'll give you what you want,

230
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,450
Take your H-energy!

231
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,610
I've told you, Kisei Chuu,

232
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,190
I won't let you hurt Hoshino anymore.

233
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,250
I don't remember I've heard that.

234
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,050
En. . Enjo. .

235
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,250
Hoshino, why are your clothes...

236
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,690
Because of you!

237
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,190
Sorry.

238
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,400
I hit it too hard...

239
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,120
Now what

240
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,100
You...

241
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:27,960
Find some cloth there.

242
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,870
Police officer, please hurry up.

243
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,180
There is weird person here.

244
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,430
Hide, Hoshino.

245
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,030
Come on, in here.

246
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,350
There's no weird ones.

247
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,410
That's strange.

248
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,210
It's here just now.

249
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,670
Stay quiet.

250
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,640
Even if he said to keep quiet,

251
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,760
but we are so close while naked.

252
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,630
No, my heart is beating so fast.

253
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:07,320
Enjo will hear my heartbeat.

254
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,860
And

255
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,400
This time, my heart beats faster.

256
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,490
She's really here just now.

257
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,540
Let's look around first.

258
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,170
They're gone now?

259
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,760
My heart is still beating so fast.

260
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,090
What the hell am I thinking?

261
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,810
I don't want to admit that I have that kind of quality.

262
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,400
But

263
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,860
If we can hang out together

264
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,610
like we used to...

265
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,490
I simply can't do anything with you.

266
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,240
If you need me so much, then I'm in.

267
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,580
Join...

268
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,750
the HXEROS team.

269
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,790
Why do you make your decision all of a sudden?

270
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,170
What else?

271
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,380
Of course it's because I can't let the Kisei Chuu get away.

272
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,670
Really?

273
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,750
But...

274
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,970
You are not allowed to collect H energy through me.

275
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,090
You are not allowed to do that through other girls.

276
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,220
I. . will try my best. .

277
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:22,930
But

278
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,480
If... really

279
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,580
under critical circumstances...

280
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,880
No!

281
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,120
You just promised! What are you doing now?

282
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,040
I … I really want to try my best no to…

283
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,170
And...

284
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,380
What were you going to say?

285
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:56,060
I won't say it again. No way.

286
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,900
What did you say to that boy?

287
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,020
What do you think?

288
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,610
That doesn't matter.

289
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,080
Let's get out of here.

290
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,190
Where?

291
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,350
Your house.

292
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,040
That's what I want to say.

293
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,280
I have a lot to learn from you and hope we get along.

294
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,760
That's great!

295
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,460
We are so worried about you.

296
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,420
So, we are the same kind of people.

297
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,210
Don't say that, Sora.

298
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,480
Maihima is the same as we are.

299
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,590
Anyway,

300
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,840
We will show her around.

301
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,420
You can go back to your room, boys.

302
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,560
Wait …

303
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,720
Okay...

304
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,560
Really tired today.

305
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,290
But I didn't expect

306
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,320
that she would actually join HXEROS.

307
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,500
Which means

308
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,570
I'm going to live with the girl I love from now on.

309
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,870
Alert! Alert!

310
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,520
A lot of Kisei Chuu appear on the street.

311
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,290
You have to move immediately.

312
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,070
Why are you all naked?

313
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,450
Because she finally joins us today

314
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,400
So we want to take a bath together and get closer.

315
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,580
Hoshino...

316
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:56,250
I still don't want to live here.

317
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,520
SUPER HXEROS

318
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,810
The next episode "Butterfly Effect"
