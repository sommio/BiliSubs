1
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,290
We're not peeping, are we?

2
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,580
Shut up and just look!

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,930
It's about to begin.

4
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,480
Peeping right early in the morning.

5
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,650
What an elegant taste, kids.

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,030
So, sorry...

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:30,820
Well

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,820
We just want to pick up the changes on the road.

9
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,860
If you just admitted it,

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,370
I might have let you have a look in there.

11
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,870
Really?

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,950
So?

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,160
Do you wanna be a hypocrite,

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,210
or an honest boy?

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,380
I... I want to...

16
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,430
Just kidding!

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,570
Don't be so nervous.

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,320
Underwear being revealed is like the shooting stars.

19
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,550
They have their value because they are hard to be seen.

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,710
Don't stare at the bottom when you are walking.

21
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,480
look up, kids.

22
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,070
Look up?

23
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,690
The goddess does exist, right?

24
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,670
SUPER HXEROS

25
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,710
Episode 7 "zero-sum game"

26
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,940
Recently in the Saitama region,

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,970
both the company and the school have seen an increase in the absence rate.

28
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,620
Those who are being absent said that,

29
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,170
They didn't want to get up because of their wonderful dream.

30
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,220
Now we are seeking solutions to deal with it as soon as possible.

31
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,220
Dream?

32
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,125
The teacher overslept, so he will be late. You will have self-study class.

33
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,240
The teachers overslept.

34
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,740
Not just the teachers.

35
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,890
Is it...

36
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,450
What.

37
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,000
Kirara, the same thing happened in your school?

38
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,270
That is to say,

39
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,460
Situations in our schools are the same?

40
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,910
Everyone said they dreamed of what they want

41
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,340
and they had a good time in their dreams.

42
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,640
I heard that some people would be sleeping all day because of that.

43
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,230
It might because

44
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,600
when people dream about what they want,

45
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,270
they can get away from the cruel reality.

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,530
And that will make people weaker. Something has this power.

47
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,950
It could be Maboroshi Chuu's doing.

48
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,970
I always wonder

49
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,620
why they keep beating about the bush.

50
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,370
Of course we would.

51
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,920
In the beginning, we want to

52
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,290
invade using peaceful approach.

53
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,360
But since the queen got missed,

54
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,460
it seemed to be out of control.

55
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,800
Things will get worse if we don't think of something to stop this.

56
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,930
We have to stop them ASAP.

57
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,270
To reach this goal,

58
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,560
let's get some H-energy first, Kirara.

59
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,470
Wait...

60
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,940
Tya Tya, Stop...

61
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,200
Stop messing around with me!

62
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,200
According to maps uncle sent us,

63
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,210
We're here.

64
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,670
It does look like the place where Kisei Chuu would hide.

65
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,780
It is kind of creepy.

66
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,770
Nice to meet you. I am Maboroshi Chuu.

67
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,920
I've been waiting, HXEROS.

68
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,530
You are here, too

69
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,200
Her Majesty, our "former" princess

70
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,780
I think you will be disappointed at the humans,

71
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,730
and regret betraying us.

72
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,210
Stop the nonsense. Come out.

73
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,210
Someones has too much H-energy here.

74
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,020
She can't wait to beat you!

75
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,170
Stop...

76
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,200
I know what you were doing.

77
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,870
You were not speaking to us through the brain,

78
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,400
but just by the microphone.

79
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,780
All right.

80
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,020
Let's fight right now.

81
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,030
What's wrong?

82
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,390
The enemy in the deepest mind

83
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,500
is your biggest enemy called "desire".

84
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,170
I... What happened?

85
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,050
Retto.

86
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,720
Hoshino.

87
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,430
Retto

88
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,100
Didn't we agree that we call each other by the name?

89
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,270
Is that so?

90
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,350
You are a bad boy.

91
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,900
We have been being in relationship.

92
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,280
Or

93
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,170
if you can answer to my question,

94
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,040
I will forgive you.

95
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,810
Now, say 10 times of "kiss".

96
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,070
Why?

97
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,220
Just do it.

98
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,250
All right.

99
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:06,350
Kiss…

100
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,900
Here comes the question.

101
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,380
Starting with 'S' and ending with 'Ki'

102
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,510
What did you say before you said kiss?

103
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,060
What kind of question is that?

104
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,660
Look at me while answering.

105
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,050
S …

106
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,780
Love

107
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,150
Nope

108
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,570
The answer is striped bass.

109
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,490
The correct answer is striped bass in the order of the family Saccharidae

110
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,990
Why does your face turn red?

111
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,440
You misunderstand something?

112
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,540
Who answer that kind of question?

113
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,730
The second question is...

114
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,920
I am gonna to do.

115
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,070
the thing that starts with 'Ki' and ends with 'S'.

116
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:50,960
What is it?

117
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,010
I really love

118
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,490
this girl.

119
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,850
But which me do you like?

120
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,710
You like the one dating you now,

121
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,320
or the one who was called Iron Virgin

122
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,340
or the one who you fell in love with in the first time.

123
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,620
or

124
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,950
the one when I was a kid.

125
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,960
Which one of me do you like best?

126
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,990
Both my mind and my body

127
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,760
could change as you want.

128
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Choose one.

129
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,260
I like

130
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,590
all of you.

131
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,130
I love all of you right here.

132
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,230
Everything about Hoshino.

133
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,470
I like all.

134
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,240
Yes, before you have changed,

135
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,200
He said all of us!

136
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,120
What a fool!

137
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,950
or after you have changed,

138
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,170
I want to share my whole life

139
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,880
with all of Hoshino!

140
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,060
If it is a dream,

141
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,240
please don't wake up.

142
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,860
Is it here, Moeno？

143
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,770
I can feel the Kisei Chuu.

144
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,570
I think there are two of them.

145
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,800
Really?

146
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,780
Finally, I'm in.

147
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,680
You are …

148
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,700
Go back to the reality now.

149
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,530
Get rid of the Maboroshi Chuu

150
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,710
No way!

151
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,920
I want to stay in this world and take care of them for my whole life.

152
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,250
Is this really that good?

153
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,420
This world, simply speaking, is a fantasy of yours.

154
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,050
You can only feel the things that you've seen or imagined.

155
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,610
But

156
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,900
If I say, after you beat the Maboroshi Chuu,

157
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,480
I can make you feel the real Hoshino and get you the experience that you can never imagine...

158
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,440
That experience...

159
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,270
is it worthy enough for me to give up all of my Hoshinos?

160
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,600
I promise you.

161
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,320
I see.

162
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,220
What should I do to come back?

163
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,120
Put it on and pinch your cheek.

164
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,300
I see.

165
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,230
Retto,

166
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,270
Wish me happy even when you go back to that world.

167
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,290
Seems like someone is about to wake up from the dream.

168
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,290
Let's enhance the sleeping wave a little bit.

169
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,480
We heard a lot of annoying noise.

170
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,950
You did it.

171
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,730
Humans.

172
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,150
Why can't I influence you with my sleeping wave?

173
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,520
I seem to have a strange dream. That's for sure.

174
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,240
But I felt nothing.

175
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,950
You should...

176
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,660
make me feel something that is much better than a sweet dream, huh?

177
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,710
You are awake now, Retto?

178
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,520
Yes,

179
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,800
we were here to beat the Maboroshi Chuu,

180
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,480
But were knocked unconscious by the Maboroshi Chuu.

181
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,660
What's that?

182
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,680
The sound comes from there.

183
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,310
Hey, wake up!

184
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,560
That's useless.

185
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,850
You can only go into their dreams to wake them up.

186
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,630
Or, finish the Maboroshi Chuu.

187
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,900
Shit.

188
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,860
Ladies, you have to wait for me.

189
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,950
You, you are …

190
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,250
Shiko

191
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,420
Here is another Kisei Chuu.

192
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,290
That one?

193
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,670
Why do you suddenly attack her?

194
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,670
Of course for killing her!

195
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,470
The child is with us.

196
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,020
So...

197
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,060
You are HXEROS of Saitama Branch

198
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,450
Let me go!

199
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,440
Indeed as expected, is this all you can do?

200
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,060
Don't think that you destroyed the base of the Kisei Chuu,

201
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,210
you can be proud of yourselves.

202
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,090
We will take it with us.

203
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,540
Goodbye!

204
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,670
Wait a minute!

205
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,340
I said it is our friend.

206
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,070
I thought you were knocked out by me.

207
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,330
I didn't expect there would be such a guy in the Saitama Branch.

208
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,140
Interesting.

209
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,640
Oh, I forgot,

210
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,590
this is the boundary between Tokyo and Saitama.

211
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,290
So whose pray is the Kisei Chuu...

212
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,930
Let's decide it in a heroic way.

213
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,990
I am Kusamura Shiko from HXEROS Tokyo Branch.

214
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,630
That's Wakakusa Moeno who speaks with a lisp.

215
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,170
Nice to meet you.

216
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,010
The rule is simple.

217
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,870
Who is turned on first

218
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,220
and releases the H-energy will lose.

219
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,680
Maboroshi Chuu. Make you obsessed with me.

220
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,930
Use H-energy to slug it out, huh?

221
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,140
Wait... What the hell are you doing?

222
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,940
What else? This is a zero-sum game.

223
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,990
The one who feels first loses.

224
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,770
You said we will do it in the HXERO way!

225
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,860
Is this what you meant?

226
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,200
What?

227
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,240
You are a HXEROS. This should be nothing to you.

228
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,730
Don't just lie there,

229
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,370
Move!

230
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,920
I can't move...

231
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,430
She used the power of XERO GEAR to greatly improve her power.

232
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,420
Huh? Finally fight back?

233
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,660
Is fighting back the only thing I can do?

234
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,600
No

235
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,800
I'm in love with Hoshino.

236
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,810
I can't do this to other girls.

237
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,530
Your master is a herbivorous man?

238
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,440
We just have to wait to see him lose.

239
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,530
Shiko seems to get into it.

240
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,200
Retto has been trained by Kirara and others everyday.

241
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,260
He won't lose to such degree of seduction.

242
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,120
If you go on like this...

243
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,380
You don't want to surrender, do you?

244
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:49,170
HXEROS in Saitama are so weak and soft...

245
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,550
Hoshino...

246
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,980
Retto, tomorrow is a holiday.

247
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,760
We put the child in bed,

248
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,740
and... Okay?

249
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,430
No, no, no, no, no. The other me.

250
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,040
Retto is in love with

251
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,960
me in this period.

252
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,480
No …

253
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,690
No!

254
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,860
Just a dream?

255
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,470
Everybody, wake up!

256
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,500
What?

257
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,410
I just had a good dream.

258
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,470
Pity. .

259
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,100
All right, Enjo, wake up.

260
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,080
Strange

261
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,520
Enjo?

262
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,360
I can't believe you can bear it.

263
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:52,870
But,

264
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,160
Looks like you are about to reach your limit.

265
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,200
He can't satisfy Shiko as well?

266
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,620
It's not good.

267
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:04,460
If they go on like this, Retto... Retto would...

268
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,140
You can't lose, Retto!

269
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,900
What's the matter?

270
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,220
Come here!

271
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,350
Let me go!

272
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,770
HXE RED "Meat status"

273
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,000
It worked!

274
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,050
What's going on …

275
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,190
I can't take. .

276
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,900
no more...

277
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,560
I'm sorry, Shiko.

278
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,890
I am no match for him...

279
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,480
Looks like you finally take it serious.

280
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,440
The guy is totally different from before.

281
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,880
But, this guy...

282
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,610
maybe he can make me feel...

283
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,290
Your body is very sensitive.

284
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,250
which means, your whole body is full of erogenous zones.

285
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,320
Is there a cure for that?

286
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,830
It's XERO GEAR.

287
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,920
It can turn your H-energy to power.

288
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,900
When the high energy consumption mode is on,

289
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,880
if you have H-energy and release your energy at once,

290
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,140
it should be able to ease your symptoms.

291
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,690
It has a side effect

292
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,810
that your body would be very jaded to outside simulations.

293
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,690
Even so, do you still want to be treated?

294
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,210
I …

295
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,690
Because of my body, I'm always afraid of touching others.

296
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,490
But...

297
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,320
I want to touch other kids at my age,

298
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,120
feel each other's warmness.

299
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,620
Even if the body can no longer be sensitive,

300
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,460
I still don't want my heart to be dull.

301
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,840
From that day on,

302
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,840
As a HXEROS,

303
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,720
I fight with the Kisei Chuu.

304
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,510
And that sensitive issue is under control because of that.

305
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,270
But there is no one who can really turn me on.

306
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:25,770
Yes,

307
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,550
Until today.

308
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,190
exactly.

309
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,670
All the heat. .

310
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,590
and the pulsations in my chest...

311
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,260
I hadn't felt that in a long time...

312
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,280
If I can...

313
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,190
make all the H-energy I have felt...

314
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,830
released at once, that would be amazing.

315
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,880
It's strange. I was...

316
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,120
Are you alright, Shiko?

317
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,430
Can you believe that we all lost?

318
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,770
I haven't leaked a drop.

319
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,800
What are you talking about?

320
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,710
I said I lost,

321
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,670
but I didn't really "let it out"!

322
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,480
Shiko is very adorable when you are turned on.

323
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,430
But you are also cute when you are nervous!

324
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,740
What are you talking about, idiot?

325
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,990
Hey, wait a minute!

326
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,010
Yes?

327
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,980
What's your name?

328
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,420
Retto.

329
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,940
My name is Retto Enjo.

330
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,660
Luckily you got his name.

331
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,670
Shut up!

332
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,840
There is another Kisei Chuu. I can smell it.

333
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,670
You guys are not strong enough!

334
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,100
HXEROS with no H-energy -Shiko!

335
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,250
are just ordinary people.

336
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,650
I want you to sleep forever.

337
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,460
Do you really think you can get away from my grasp?

338
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,740
Everyone

339
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,310
The Light of the Sky!

340
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,890
Lamaze Cannon!

341
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,490
Where are you touching, asshole!

342
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,700
You just did that to me!

343
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,740
Are you all right, Enjo?

344
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,080
Is everyone all right?

345
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,330
They are?

346
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,710
They are HXEORS from the Tokyo Branch.

347
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,210
Moeno!

348
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,880
Momoka!

349
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,040
You guys know each other?

350
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,870
We were in the same school before.

351
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,750
I moved to Tokyo because I was admitted to a private high school.

352
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,020
You haven't change a bit.

353
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,160
What do you mean by that?

354
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,940
So,

355
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,440
You still want to take Tya Tya away?

356
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,240
Listen,

357
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,400
I won't give up.

358
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,010
You will be mine!

359
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,950
Keep that in your mind!

360
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,950
Goodbye.

361
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,080
You seems to become the target of a terrible girl.

362
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:33,920
Tya Tya.

363
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,790
So, what happened?

364
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,710
I don't remember it clearly.

365
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,760
But,

366
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,380
Retto is really impressive when he becomes a beast!

367
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,930
Stop it.

368
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,690
You will be mine!

369
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,720
Keep that in your mind!

370
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,880
That means you, Retto Enjo.

371
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,440
SUPER HXEROS
