1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
Mount Chichibu

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:10,780
Hakkou Chuu, Taran Chuu, Jiko Chuu, Pan Chuu

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,030
and many others...

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,840
There are so many casualties in Saitama alone

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,740
Hey, listen

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,340
You didn't forget our target, did you?

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,640
Yes, Your Majesty

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,430
Our target

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,620
is to prevent human reproduction which requires

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,610
H-Energy and lead the energy to extinction

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,240
then, to invade this planet

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,880
Exactly

13
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,920
If the humans face up to us, we're gonna lose

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,970
To achieve our goal

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,660
first things first, we have to deal with the HXERO who hinders us

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,460
Don't worry

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,380
I have an elaborate plan to capture them all

18
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,840
Looking forward to your performance

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,880
Lascivious fools

20
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,830
One of your three desires

21
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,010
is approaching disappearance

22
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,700
SUPER HXEROS

23
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,240
Episode 4 "Snow White and the Color of the Sky"

24
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,010
Finally, I got you, HXE WHITE

25
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,470
Come on, if you wanna survive

26
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,380
tell me where your friends are

27
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,540
No way

28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,730
Soft breasts

29
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,970
but you are just tough as nails

30
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,480
Humans with a figure like yours

31
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,540
is our object

32
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,930
I'm gonna teach you a lesson

33
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,400
and you'll never be against us

34
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,780
Is anything over now?

35
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,400
Momoka, Sora, Hoshino, and Enjo

36
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
I'm sorry

37
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,290
What're you doing, Rumba?

38
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,670
It's all Rumba fault

39
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,930
to bring me a weird dream

40
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,050
Morning

41
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,100
Morning

42
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,490
Excuse me, I wanna wash my face

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,980
Shirayuki

44
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,170
the Senior High School Department of Saitama Girl's school

45
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,570
My heart is still beating so fast.

46
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,910
Good morning, Maihime

47
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,860
You wear orange today

48
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,170
so it's Tuesday

49
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,890
Stop making my panties your calendar

50
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,680
What if some other people sees them.

51
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,300
Nothing's gonna happen

52
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,480
We are on campus right now

53
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,680
Oh, Chiya

54
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,640
Oh, didn't you wear your black leggings today?

55
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,110
I was in a hurry to attend school

56
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,640
Yes?

57
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,320
She's Hoya Chiya

58
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,740
She's like a prince in this school

59
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,650
and my playmate

60
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:02,210
I have no talents but a strong reaction to sex, and in comparison

61
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,170
Chiya is...

62
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,610
All done

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,720
That's you, Chiya

64
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,600
Fantastic calligraphy.

65
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,050
How about yours, Maihime

66
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,270
When would you finish?

67
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,690
Are you ok?

68
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,360
You seem to be blushing today

69
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,390
Is it？

70
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,500
But I'm totally fine

71
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,710
You're pretending again

72
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,280
Your feet must be numb, aren't they?

73
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,210
Sorry

74
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,810
She's so beautiful

75
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,170
And her dance is amazing

76
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,770
In contrast

77
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,010
Keep up with the beat, Shirayuki

78
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,990
I apologize

79
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,480
It hurts

80
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,820
Stop, stop

81
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,990
Are you ok, Maihime

82
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,620
I'm fine

83
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,620
She makes trouble to Chiya

84
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,450
I just couldn't stand this clumsy girl

85
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,300
Forget it, Maihime

86
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,380
One day, you're gonna

87
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,930
find your talent

88
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,540
People just didn't get that

89
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,890
in fact, you do have a lot of advantages

90
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,690
For example?

91
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,760
Like …

92
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,650
You express and behave sentimentally

93
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,630
You have big boobs

94
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
and full butt

95
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,700
But they don't seem like strengths actually

96
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,650
Oh

97
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,290
Or... you can try to join different clubs

98
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,500
then

99
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,330
you may be able to find out your new talents

100
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,500
Nah, let it go

101
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,150
If I join a club

102
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,150
people would get into trouble because of me

103
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,220
Why do you keep being so humble

104
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,390
But I like your gentleness

105
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,460
And I'm occupied with my part-time job after school

106
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,030
Well, now you should tell me

107
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,560
what kind of work you are doing

108
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,570
No... I can't

109
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,150
Wait

110
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,240
My bento's gonna... -Tell me

111
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,170
Get ready for your death, Kisei Chuu

112
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,830
You must think that I am about to fail, huh

113
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,200
I'm gonna show you my secret tentacle …

114
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,270
No, my secret skill

115
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,870
It is heard that someone suspicious broke into the campus just now

116
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,280
All students please retreat to the gym

117
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,670
Again

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,700
There is someone suspicious...

119
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,550
It's Kisei Chuu's reaction

120
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,010
So that means...

121
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,630
They asked us to retreat?

122
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,330
For suspicious people? Why

123
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,410
do we need to do that?

124
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,180
That's weird, where's Maihime?

125
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,650
What are you doing?

126
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,890
You do appear, Kisei Chuu

127
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,560
As long as I'm here

128
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,350
you could do nothing

129
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,680
You are …

130
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,780
HXEROS

131
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,950
Oh, then I can tell Ma'am something cheering

132
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,120
Ma'am?

133
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,170
What is that

134
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,500
This is the same feeling

135
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,590
as what I experienced in my dream this morning

136
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,180
No, no

137
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,150
It was really dangerous

138
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,800
The dream almost came true

139
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,650
I feel terrible

140
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,640
That sound is …

141
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,370
Enjo

142
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,950
Shirayuki

143
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,410
Why did you become like this

144
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,750
When I came to my sense, I turned into this

145
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,830
I think

146
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,410
the Kisei Chuu must have

147
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,380
an ability that can change a person she touched into one of her tentacles

148
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,260
that is to say, those tentacles are all …

149
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,890
They may all be the students of this school

150
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,490
Exactly

151
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,830
My skill is

152
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,020
to change people who have absorbed H-Energy into my tentacles

153
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,660
and with these tentacles, I gain the H-Energy

154
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,400
Then, I can do more

155
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:19,070
I named it the Human Tentacles Plan

156
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,080
That really is a long-term plan

157
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,580
Come on

158
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,840
Are you able to break this net and attack me?

159
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,750
It's coming, Shirayuki

160
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,040
I can do it

161
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,560
I'm the only one who can do it

162
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,420
There would be no problem today

163
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,300
I'll protect you all

164
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,350
"Lamaze Cannon"

165
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,360
You... you made it

166
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,830
Enjo

167
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,500
I'm sorry, Shirayuki

168
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,460
There is a suspicious person

169
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,590
Sorry

170
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,760
Are you fine, Shirayuki

171
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,720
Yes

172
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,060
Though I don't know what's going on

173
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,480
Maihime, it seems that you've found

174
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,230
you own talent

175
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,610
Thank you

176
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,360
What happened

177
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,290
I am Shimi Chuu

178
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,250
I won't allow any existence of erotica

179
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,090
Enjo

180
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,930
About yesterday

181
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,100
You mean... in my room

182
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,680
I didn't mean to

183
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,150
um... I was in a mess

184
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,520
Anyway, that was not the real me

185
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,980
Got it?

186
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,700
Yes, you should take a step back right now

187
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,090
You …

188
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,830
What the hell are you thinking about

189
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,330
Hentai

190
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,950
What about you?

191
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,640
I found it

192
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,640
The Ideal "H" eroine

193
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,480
What the heck is she doing

194
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,570
What's wrong

195
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,400
So it seems

196
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,370
Sora likes you very much

197
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,500
Is that what she meant

198
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,750
I'm not sure

199
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,770
Yeh

200
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Momoka

201
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,500
She

202
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,340
appears to always stay in her room, drawing something

203
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,560
But she never shows us

204
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,100
We need more time to know each other

205
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,480
But as long as we could make friends in the future

206
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,480
it's gonna be a happy life

207
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,740
You're right

208
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,860
Since I'm gonna live here

209
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,120
I need to know more about the others

210
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,430
Soymilk

211
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,770
Let's share this and get along well with each other

212
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,290
That's …

213
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,720
Is it ok to drink that?

214
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,340
What are you two talking about？

215
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,010
Showing your attitude that you don't need to have it because you have large boobs

216
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,620
Shit-Wait

217
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,470
Like …

218
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,320
Oh

219
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,370
Momoka

220
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,220
Sorry

221
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,020
Stop licking there

222
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,570
Come on

223
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,760
Go, Rumba, go

224
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,030
Anyhow

225
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,450
this is what Taoyuan and Shirayuki are like

226
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,840
This is...

227
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,470
Y-You saw？

228
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,340
Sorry

229
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,730
I didn't mean to peek

230
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,350
The notebook was on the floor

231
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,150
and I wanted pick it up, but...

232
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,280
Anyway you're good at drawing, Tenkuzi

233
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,330
No one in this house has seen them yet

234
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,490
Now that you know

235
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,370
I have to take embarrassing pictures of you to keep you silence

236
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,830
What? Why?

237
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,540
Because I know

238
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,340
the source of Sora's H energy is different from others'

239
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,430
And I know it's weird

240
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,510
But I like it too much to stop

241
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,540
When I settled back down to my conciousness, I was painting myself

242
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,480
If they all know it, I'm sure I'm gonna be laughed at

243
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,520
No

244
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,190
Everybody has a secretive interesting or past

245
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,450
Me, too

246
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,910
So I can understand how you feel

247
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,160
So

248
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,910
there is no reason for you to stop.

249
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,280
Besides

250
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,080
before you're ready to tell others

251
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,540
I won't say a word

252
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,250
I promise you

253
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,230
Ok?

254
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,760
Ok, I forgive you now

255
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,850
But...

256
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,120
since you've seen my most embarrasing things

257
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,940
I wanna see yours

258
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,070
Is it...

259
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,440
The image of the character which I'm drawing in my manga

260
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,440
is perfectly fitted by you

261
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,280
I can't do it well unless I see the real things

262
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,290
So that's what it meant

263
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,830
I can't see them well with your sheet there

264
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,250
Ok

265
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,560
If my body could help you

266
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,420
refer to it as you want

267
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,600
Really?

268
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,470
Then...

269
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,080
Sora?

270
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,390
What do you want me to do with the flute

271
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,920
Umm

272
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,100
I want to draw a picture that a clumsy girl slips

273
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,460
with a flute between her boobs and I want your help as a reference

274
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,620
So, put it between your breasts

275
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,820
What kind of manga is it?

276
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,430
For example

277
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,530
Enjo

278
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,370
I can't stand it any more

279
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,830
I was in the next room

280
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,410
and Hoshino was naked here

281
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,710
You are tempting me to come here, aren't you?

282
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,500
You brought it on

283
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,090
It's this kind of manga

284
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,050
Briefly, erotica

285
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,630
So she could express in this way? !

286
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,390
What?

287
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,400
Emergency alert, emergency alert

288
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,660
A Kisei Chuu has appeared at the bookshop in town

289
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,110
And please go ahead immediately, HXEROS

290
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,910
Let's go, Kirara

291
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,950
Get ready

292
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,990
Did you hear that?

293
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,460
Knock on the door at least when you barge into a girl's room

294
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,160
So here is the bookshop where provides a mass of erotica

295
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,850
Why would it be at such an unnoticeable spot

296
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,190
But according to Ma'am, it should all be censored

297
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,690
Go! My bugs!

298
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,950
What's happening?

299
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,740
Protect the people outside, Momozono and Shirayuki

300
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,550
Ok

301
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:47,750
We count on you

302
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,250
What's this?

303
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
What's wrong, Tenkuzi?

304
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,050
This is my favorite bookstore

305
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,720
And they are destroying it

306
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,720
they would pay for it

307
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,640
Tenkuzi

308
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,230
HXEROS

309
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,700
You, deal with them

310
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,040
She escaped

311
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,530
I'll seize her

312
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,960
But I have no idea what to do

313
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,250
It's ok

314
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,760
Sora, you are...

315
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,100
It is my XERO GEAR

316
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,560
enboding my H-Energy in wings

317
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,310
You can do this? !

318
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,520
As long as you can imagine that

319
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,980
it's really easy

320
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,750
But

321
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,410
we're surrounded by too many enemies

322
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,280
There is still someone here

323
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,100
Thank you

324
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,290
Are you all right, Kirara?

325
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,220
Even though I could use my power

326
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,920
I could do that at least

327
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,240
Let me handle it

328
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,060
Retreat with her

329
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,390
Come on, follow me

330
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,100
Ok

331
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,440
Thank you, Kirara

332
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,610
My drawings

333
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,110
haven't been seen by anyone because of my embarrassment

334
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,030
But it felt so great to be praised

335
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,870
So... they...

336
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,740
Solar Ray

337
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,250
Well done, Sora

338
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,530
Yeh, truly

339
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,000
Retto

340
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,020
Tenkuzi, where are your clothes

341
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,420
Never mind... Kirara was

342
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,860
She was

343
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,490
Your Majesty

344
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,580
We successfully

345
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,600
captured a harmless member of HXEROS

346
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,430
Have you told her our demand?

347
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:36,960
Yes

348
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,000
If she don't want her H-Energy totally taken out

349
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,550
bring her companions here

350
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,470
Great job

351
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,140
Then

352
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,260
Let's go get prepared for it

353
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,320
Once HXEROS can be eliminated

354
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,190
the plan can go further

355
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,730
to castrate humans through regulation

356
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,600
Wait for me, Hoshino

357
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,440
SUPER HXEROS

358
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,740
The next episode "HXEROS. RISING"
