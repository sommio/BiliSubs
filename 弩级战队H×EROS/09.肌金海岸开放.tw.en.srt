1
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,380
But it's kind of sudden

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,840
yes.

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,960
I don't know what kind of  reason it is.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,220
In order to reward all of you for your active performance,

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,430
I can't believe that a two-day and one-night trip to the beach will as a gift.

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,270
Is it possible to say

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,800
while we are away…

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,980
Give the Tya Tya to...

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,320
No

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,280
Tya Tya will stay in the Saitama branch to be taken care of

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,030
You guys don't need to worry.

12
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,240
Yeah

13
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,060
I'll take care of Tya Tya and Rumba

14
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,250
You should stretch and relax once in a while

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,130
sea

16
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,990
SUPER HXEROS

17
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,690
Episode 9 "Golden Coast opening"

18
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,700
Then I'll pick you guys up again tomorrow

19
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,910
Until then, you guys have fun

20
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,330
Thank you, sir

21
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,630
sea

22
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,800
I didn't expect that there would be such a sand in the city.

23
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,640
Golden Coast

24
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,610
I've never been here before

25
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,190
But it seems to be a very famous tourist attraction

26
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,510
and

27
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,620
It is mentioned above that the first nude sand program in our country is being carried out here.

28
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,770
I don't understand

29
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,530
Then again

30
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,190
There seem not to be any tourists here

31
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,650
Great

32
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,040
It feels like it's been wrapped up by us

33
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,490
Good

34
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,820
The first person to enter the sea

35
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,040
can be added an extra course to dinner

36
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,600
Accept the challenge

37
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,210
Wait a minute, Sora  Enjo Retto

38
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,340
I'll lay the beach mat

39
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,820
Hoshino, let's go and play together

40
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,340
Well, I'm sorry

41
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,900
You guys, well

42
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,990
Don't leave me on the sidelines.

43
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,510
Hoshino is so unfrank

44
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,270
Well

45
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,790
I have to wear sunscreen, too

46
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,390
It's so comfortable

47
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,050
This is my first visit to the seaside

48
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,190
What are you guys doing

49
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,490
Now that we have come to play at the seaside

50
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,610
we should at least experience the salty taste of the sea

51
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,860
There seems to be something on my hand...

52
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,290
What's that

53
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,710
What is this? Is it a sea cucumber

54
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,280
I saw this breed for the first time

55
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,720
How dare you touch that disgusting thing

56
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,180
It's not poisonous and harmful. Don't worry

57
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,550
Really

58
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,980
How is that harmless

59
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,080
That's strange

60
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,770
This seems to be a very rare variety.

61
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,230
Come and help me

62
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,040
What's wrong with these guys

63
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,340
Is it just...

64
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,520
Well, what on earth is that

65
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,440
There's no way to enjoy a sea bath

66
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,300
Rarely come to the seaside

67
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,730
But there is no way to play in the sea

68
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,440
sorry

69
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,200
I'm going to go to the bathroom

70
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,950
Well, we'll wait for you here first

71
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,870
Sorry to keep you waiting

72
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,630
As I haven't had any guests for a long time

73
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,130
it took me some time to prepare

74
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,940
No, it's all our fault

75
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,480
Because we left the beach earlier than originally expected

76
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,640
That's why we came early. I'm sorry

77
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,900
Does it mean that the guests have entered the sea

78
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,940
Then everyone must be surprised

79
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,360
Right

80
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,480
What on earth are those creatures

81
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:49,180
Think what you see is "iron cannon sea cucumber"

82
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,110
Iron cannon sea cucumber

83
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,550
Actually

84
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,990
It's the name given by our locals

85
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,040
At the beginning of the year  a large number of new species of sea cucumbers began to appear

86
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,800
No matter how much it is cleared, the number is still increasing

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,460
As a result, the number of tourists visiting the beach continues to decrease.

88
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,880
It's really nerve-racking

89
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,800
Although I am very sorry to you guests

90
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,760
Please give up the idea of playing in the sea this time

91
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,640
That's too bad

92
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,600
So bad that it's rare to have a chance to take a vacation

93
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,410
Look at you

94
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,730
We invited someone to expel sea cucumbers today

95
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,770
But they seem to be late

96
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,950
Hello, we're here to expel sea cucumbers

97
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,300
They seem to have just arrived

98
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,670
Wait for... What are you doing here

99
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,460
That's what I'm going to say

100
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,550
Both of You calm down

101
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,840
What's going on

102
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,570
What a lovely cleaner

103
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,400
Damn it

104
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,930
I don't know if you're here for a trip or something else

105
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,060
But of course there's only one reason we're here

106
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,610
Let me see

107
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,070
Which way is the hall?

108
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,830
sorry

109
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,250
Excuse me, do you know where the men' toilet is

110
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,330
If you want to find the men's room, it's right over there.

111
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,040
Thanks

112
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,920
There are fewer tourists

113
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,510
There are people about our age

114
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,520
Excuse me

115
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,680
Can it be said that you are Enjo Retto

116
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,260
That's right

117
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,140
I'm a big fan of yours.

118
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,600
Please shake my hand

119
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,690
It seems too slow to speak after holding it

120
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,470
I'm fine

121
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,830
Don't you have to go to the bathroom

122
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,550
Oh

123
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,190
Excuse me

124
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,030
What's going on

125
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,870
I see

126
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,500
Well

127
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,540
We're here to work, while you're here to play

128
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,900
But there is such a coincidence in the world

129
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,000
Could this be part of my sir's plan

130
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,420
It's possible

131
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,300
So

132
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,900
Didn't the Enjo Retto come here today

133
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,140
So there is one person missing

134
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,180
Sure enough everyone is here

135
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,930
What

136
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,620
It turns out that the two of them have already met

137
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,650
Enjo

138
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,480
You guys... What are you doing here

139
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,640
What's the matter? Haven't you explained it to him yet

140
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,820
Sorry

141
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,700
I've heard the rumors about you, Enjo Retto

142
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,820
I am Ginkgo

143
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,950
For the time being, I am the leader of the Tokyo branch

144
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,450
The man who looks fragile is the Great River Orange Horse

145
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,960
Welcome your comments

146
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,520
When those two men acted on their own a while ago

147
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,860
It seems to have caused you trouble

148
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,630
I'm so sorry

149
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,170
Forget about that

150
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,300
So, now that everyone's here

151
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,220
Let's go, Saitama Branch

152
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,270
How is it going, Moeno

153
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,940
Because the smell of the tide is not easy to tell

154
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,270
But there should be no Kisei Chuu around here

155
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,820
According to the locals

156
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,320
When expelling sea cucumbers

157
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,780
There have been several sightings of what appears to be a Kisei Chuu creature.

158
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,410
There's nothing we can do

159
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,080
We have no choice but to expel these guys before it comes out

160
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,200
They say that Kisei Chuu... What on earth is going on

161
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,460
Well

162
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,710
According to the investigation of the Tokyo branch

163
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,510
There is Kisei Chuu lurking on this coast

164
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,650
And use those sea cucumbers to make the beach unusable

165
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,660
Their battles really beat around the bush

166
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,310
I heard the landlady say that just now

167
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,060
We can't ignore it.

168
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,100
That's why I decided to help now

169
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,080
That's right

170
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,310
So

171
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,690
It is said that if you want to deport, how to do it in detail…

172
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,990
What are you doing

173
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,750
Do what? We're expelling sea cucumbers

174
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,040
This kind of iron cannon sea cucumber will spray water to intimidate

175
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,550
But as long as a certain amount of water is spurted out

176
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,460
It will shrink and become unable to move

177
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,280
We need to rely on this battle to infuriate the Kisei Chuu

178
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,010
To draw her out

179
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,140
Then please help me, too

180
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,060
I didn't hear about this kind of help

181
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,680
Does Sora want to help, too

182
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,230
I'm sorry. I won't hurt you

183
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,230
There's really nothing I can do about it

184
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,360
What are we going to do

185
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,530
It would be nice to let people who like to do that kind of thing

186
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,580
Can't stand it

187
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,200
You guys are embarrassing HXEROS

188
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,460
I'm going to punish you for being so careless

189
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,720
So... Then let's go over there and deal with it

190
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,010
Just do it

191
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,220
It's not Vladivostok. It's a sea cucumber worm

192
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,730
It's nice to have Orange Horse here

193
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,360
This male-to-female ratio is so strange

194
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,990
It is often said that girls tend to feel more pleasure

195
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,430
But is it okay for us to be so far away from everyone

196
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,700
Now, if there is a Kisei Chuu

197
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,960
it should be all right

198
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,250
Although it was not the original intention

199
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,920
But just now I have saved an H-Energy that Kisei Chuu shares.

200
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,250
You're really good

201
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,480
Well, I have a favor to ask you

202
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,270
Please be my master

203
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,520
The reason why Cong Yu and Ruocao often act separately

204
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,600
is because of me

205
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,770
The source of my H-energy is a little strange

206
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,610
Because it's hard to store energy

207
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,570
So the mission always fails

208
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,240
I've made trouble for the three of them several times

209
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:04,820
But

210
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,700
I heard that there are powerful heroes in Saitama who can sense H-Energy no matter what they do

211
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,540
So I have always admired Enjo

212
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,080
Is that a compliment

213
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,260
So if you have a knack for sensing H-energy

214
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,380
Please be sure to teach me

215
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,340
You ask me the secret

216
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,260
I don't usually force myself to store it

217
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,840
Is it

218
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,970
I'm sorry to ask such a strange question

219
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,970
No

220
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,270
But I know how you feel as a boy trying to protect a member of the team

221
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,450
So as a HXEROS

222
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,710
I hope I can give you a hand

223
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,770
Really

224
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,250
So before that  as your friend

225
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,700
I want to know the H-energy source of Orange Horse first

226
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,870
But it's embarrassing

227
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,370
Don't be such an outsider

228
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,700
It doesn't matter if we're all boys

229
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,990
It's actually

230
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,840
The sound just now

231
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,340
is from the girls

232
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,010
This is...

233
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,330
Kisei Chuu

234
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:12,950
Sea cucumber worm

235
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,270
You deserve it  humans

236
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,760
How dare you treat my lovely pets

237
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,730
in such an excessive way

238
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,610
Human H-energy is easy to accumulate in sensitive areas

239
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,450
How long can they hold out before H-energy dries up

240
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,290
I'm going to do what I did to other beach tourists

241
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,580
Squeeze out all your H energy

242
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,050
Damn it. It doesn't work at all...

243
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,540
Kirara

244
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,240
Didn't you say you were sucked a little bit

245
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,610
What's gonna happen

246
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,700
That's what you say, but it's such a disgusting situation

247
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,900
There is no way to feel H-energy at all

248
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,870
Orange Horse, come with me

249
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,940
I will attack the Noumenon of the Kisei Chuu later

250
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,800
The orange horse took advantage of this time    to take off the sea cucumbers on everyone

251
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,700
I see

252
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,320
That's weird

253
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,350
I obviously saw a picture like that

254
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,200
I have no sense of H-energy at all

255
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,780
Master  behind you

256
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,140
It looks like there are humans hiding in other places

257
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,040
Come on and go away, damn it

258
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,540
Are you all right

259
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,000
Barely

260
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,090
But

261
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,800
My H-energy has almost been sucked away

262
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,630
I'm afraid it's impossible to knock her down with one blow

263
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,840
So orange horse

264
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,270
It's up to you to save everyone

265
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,800
I can't do it

266
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,350
Do you want us to help each other store H energy

267
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,150
This is really forcing people to do something difficult

268
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,190
That's right

269
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,530
Then I haven't finished what I just said

270
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,560
No matter what the source of your H energy is

271
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,200
I wish I could help you

272
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,950
Although the team they belong to is different

273
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,220
we're all partners. Aren't we

274
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,700
Master

275
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,120
You're right

276
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,040
You can't hide like this all the time

277
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,080
I can't believe he showed up on his own initiative

278
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,170
You men have a lot of courage

279
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,800
Orange horse

280
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,090
Is it really okay to give it to you

281
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,220
Isn't that what you said?  Master

282
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,850
Now it's up to me to store H-energy

283
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,550
But you just didn't tell me. This is really...

284
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,310
Sorry

285
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,000
Sorry

286
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,550
That's right

287
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,390
My H-energy source

288
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,950
That's

289
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,400
Viewing H-Energy from the perspective of a third party

290
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,040
Wait... Where are your hands touching

291
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,380
It was the Orange Horse who suddenly pushed me...

292
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,300
Master's technique of receiving are really superb

293
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,630
To be able to land so accurately on a woman's body

294
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,130
See it with your own eyes like this

295
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,050
It feels far more exciting than watching a movie

296
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,330
There seems to be something inside me...

297
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,770
It's coming out

298
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,520
Is it possible to say that   you are...

299
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:14,190
The legendary... HXE... RO... S...

300
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,920
I didn't expect that orange horse would defeat the Kisei Chuu  one day

301
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,130
Everyone of the Saitama Branch

302
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,220
Thank you so much today

303
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,600
It would be nice if I could give you some thank-you gifts

304
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,850
Yu Na's personality is so serious

305
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,560
That's right

306
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,310
Take it as a thank you  Would you like to come to Tokyo tomorrow

307
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,320
If you don't mind   I'll show you around

308
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,550
Damn it

309
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,150
Why are you making your own decisions   Yu Na

310
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,660
Sorry

311
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,530
Is it true that Kusamura doesn't want to participate

312
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,000
If Enjo Retto will go

313
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,410
Of course I'll be there

314
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,610
What a surprise

315
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,630
Look  Sunset

316
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,850
Although a lot has happened today

317
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,250
But the thought of protecting the scenery

318
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,940
I think it's all worth it

319
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,610
Are you all right  Master

320
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,900
Do you have any abrasions on your body

321
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,490
It's okay

322
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,990
But thank you so much for today

323
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,910
Thank you for listening to my request

324
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,410
Don't worry about this trifle

325
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,120
But I really envy you

326
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,170
How do you exercise your body

327
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,340
I did do some retraining

328
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,050
I think it's better for Orange Horses to gain more weight

329
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,080
Orange horse

330
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,970
I don't think there's anything else you're not telling me

331
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,060
No

332
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,700
Yeah, that's good

333
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,780
Sorry

334
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,900
My nipples are a little bigger than the others

335
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,070
So I feel very embarrassed

336
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,030
Never mind

337
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,670
I just feel like it's weird to have a crotch

338
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,590
Was the sea cucumber glued to the body just now

339
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,920
You should have noticed earlier

340
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,670
Scared me

341
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,360
The skin is really exposed too much

342
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,320
I can't watch it anymore. help him put it back on, okay

343
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,660
It's dawn

344
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,120
Are you all up, boys

345
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,290
You don't have to shout so loud and we can hear you

346
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,800
Are you so dissatisfied with your desires  Retto

347
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,430
I'm sorry. I didn't even notice

348
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,590
What's going on

349
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,500
If you said to me earlier

350
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,000
I can help you, too

351
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,600
That's not like that

352
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,520
That's right

353
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,900
Help me  Orange Horse

354
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,030
Good morning  Master

355
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,120
Thank you so much

356
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,460
Today, my son heard that the sea cucumbers on the coast had disappeared

357
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,850
We are so excited

358
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,290
Thanks to all of you, this is finally saved

359
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,850
We provide free meals in the morning

360
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,250
Please enjoy it

361
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:06,930
So

362
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,060
Are they going to take us to Tokyo for sightseeing later

363
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,450
I don't know where it will take us to visit

364
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,440
Well

365
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,020
I'd like to consult you guys first

366
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,850
I want to go to a place where I can heal my body and mind

367
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,280
I want to see if there are any new heroes around

368
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:32,030
I hope to see the food attractions... Kind of like that

369
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,870
Is there really such a perfect place

370
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,410
In that case

371
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,000
I see

372
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,130
That place should be very suitable

373
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,630
Is it

374
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,800
The kids in the Tokyo branch...

375
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,440
I was just about to pick them up

376
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,890
Never mind

377
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,940
Well, be careful on that road

378
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,700
In that case, I'll get some sleep first

379
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,470
SUPER HXEROS

380
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,580
Next time, "two Kirara"
