1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,280
I'm getting used to it.

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,250
From today,

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,710
HXEROS will be dissolved.

4
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,720
Welcome back.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,900
Tya Tya，We come back.

6
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,610
What's wrong with your hair?

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,610
You didn't come back until morning. Are you very mature enough?

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,460
W... What? until today morning?

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,420
It's not like what you think...

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,610
We will go to Anno home together tonight.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,940
What happened?

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,600
It's a secret.

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,990
Oh! Uncle did not answer the phone.

14
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,010
Do you know what's wrong with him?

15
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,730
I just know that he went out to pick up Jiji. I don't know what happened after that.

16
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,600
OK.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,310
We'll call him when we are going to go.

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,660
Okay!

19
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,740
SUPER HXEROS

20
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,660
Episode 11 "Goodbye HXEROS"

21
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,400
Not a big deal.

22
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,260
Are you okay?

23
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,810
It's just finished.

24
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,580
Come on, Enjo Retto. Get away from that guy.

25
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,860
Well, too pity.

26
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,110
You treat it too lightly, guy.

27
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,210
What happened just now?

28
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,130
Enjo Retto, are you ok?

29
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,660
A piece of cake. I just got poked. It's okay.

30
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,980
What is the exact ability of that Kisei Chuu?

31
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,110
It's...

32
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,580
Uh!

33
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,590
There seems to be a strange feeling in my lower body.

34
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,530
The Kisei Chuu just now is called the feminization bug.

35
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,730
It separates the masculine features of the stabbed males.

36
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,570
And gradually feminize you, which is terrilble.

37
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,130
That is,

38
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,210
the weasel-like thing that just ran away was...

39
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,610
the male root of Enjo Retto

40
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,600
It's really gone.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,860
My male roots are gone.

42
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,190
If you don't get it back quickly to put it back in place

43
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,840
It will never get back.

44
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,740
What? Are you kidding me?

45
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,200
After I officially take over governor,

46
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,250
I will change the existing regulations in accordance with the election convention

47
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,390
to reduce the tax loss

48
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,080
doing my best to build a healthy society

49
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,440
It should have escaped from here.

50
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,940
Thanks everyone.

51
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,890
What's wrong with you, Tya Tya?

52
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,690
It's ok.

53
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,830
Well, where did it go?

54
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,280
That way! Over there.

55
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:49,730
Oh.

56
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,710
We finally caught it.

57
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,700
What are you doing, so slowly?

58
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,790
We'll be late, if we don't put it back soon.

59
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,410
But, how to do it?

60
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,340
Hold it and touch the original part.

61
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,980
My body?

62
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,680
It really feels more feminine than before.

63
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,020
Do you want me to help?

64
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,390
No, Thanks.

65
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,120
I am back.

66
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,300
Damn!

67
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,080
Freeze!

68
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,020
Where's my "root"?

69
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,850
You must have mistaken me. I just...

70
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,710
Excuse me, who are you?

71
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,000
Shirayuki didn't recognize me?

72
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,700
Well... I'm Enjo Retto's sister, Crimson.

73
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,480
I have something to talk with my brother.

74
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,320
That's it.

75
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,200
I'm going to get some tea. Please come in.

76
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,280
OK.

77
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,230
What happened, Miss Crimson?

78
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,440
You doesn't seem well.

79
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,000
This feeling. Could it be that...

80
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,180
I should go to the toilets.

81
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,670
OK. Rumba, stay there.

82
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,500
Look at this, Kirara.

83
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,970
You should do like this when you bathe Rumba.

84
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,470
You don't have to use too much bubbles.

85
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,830
Rumba easily gets itself dirty.

86
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,720
This's just all right.

87
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,680
Right? Rumba.

88
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,200
WHO?

89
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,140
Who's that next to him?

90
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,340
The warm feeling...

91
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,000
A bad feeling comes to me.

92
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,770
Hey, who are you?

93
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,520
This is Miss Crimson, Enjo's sister

94
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,720
She seems to be the pet's owner.

95
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,330
Are you Miss Crimson?

96
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,620
I haven't seen you for a while. You seem to have grown a lot stronger.

97
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,540
Really?

98
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,530
Oh no... Hoshino knows that guy.

99
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,830
Rumba, it's too dangerous.

100
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,320
Ouch...

101
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,520
Kirara, how did you suddenly slip down?

102
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,360
If you have any grievance, turn to Rumba to complain.

103
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,780
I think I might as well take a shower.

104
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,200
Okay.

105
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,240
Will you like to wash together, sister?

106
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,950
Your clothes are all wet.

107
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,230
Come on. Forget it.

108
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,660
Alright, alright, you don't need to do that.

109
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,050
Besides,

110
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,630
I also want to know about the weakness of Enjo Retto.

111
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,240
I never thought Taoyuan, this guy would be so strong.

112
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,130
How old are you, Crimson?

113
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,930
Fifteen.

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,810
Isn't that as same age as Sora?

115
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,260
But I didn't know that Enjo Retto has a sister.

116
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,200
I used to play with her, too.

117
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:05,920
So...

118
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,440
Crimson, have you falled in love?

119
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,050
Not yet.

120
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,030
Unbelievable!

121
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,080
Your breasts grow bigger than mine. Very plump!

122
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,970
Does your elder brother have someone he likes now?

123
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,630
I don't mean anything special.

124
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,380
Momoka just said she wanted to ask your brother's weaknesses,

125
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,460
so I...

126
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,880
I'm not sure what the guy is thinking.

127
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,180
But I'm sure that

128
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,510
Whether it was before and now

129
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,750
He remains the same as pure as he's in elementary school.

130
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,230
Your little sister speaks well.

131
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,280
What does the weasel doing?

132
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,200
I don't know.

133
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,180
Do you also want us to help washing it?

134
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,010
Ok, I will help you.

135
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,580
What's that...

136
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,290
How about it? Comfortable?

137
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,270
It seems too nice.

138
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,760
It's like my "root".

139
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,490
being cleaned by those two.

140
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,800
I'm going out first.

141
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,230
What's the matter, Crimson?

142
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,980
Nothing with that weasel?

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,060
Enjo Retto...

144
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,900
What the hell is going on here?

145
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,990
What we just talked

146
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,370
had been heard by him?

147
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,990
They're here again.

148
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,830
Broadcast the next news for you.

149
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,580
With the inauguration of the new governor,

150
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,040
The first arrested person has been made as a result of the new legislation.

151
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,340
Come here everyone,

152
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,240
The suspect is arrested for committing the crime of compulsory underage indecent assault.

153
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,390
It is said to be an employee of the Saitama City Hall.

154
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,650
It's part of an unidentified department called the Earth Defense Force.

155
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,140
Is it really?

156
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,070
I can't believe uncle will be arrested.

157
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,440
No problem, Enjo Retto.

158
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,900
Anyway, he's your uncle.

159
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,820
There must be some mistakes.

160
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,070
But it has been reported that he's a criminal suspect.

161
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,320
Sora

162
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,990
Enjo Retto

163
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,950
Anno gave me this.

164
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,130
He said he'll leave it to you, if anything happens.

165
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,520
Then you can wear the HXEROS battle suit.

166
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,030
HXEROS battle suit?

167
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,510
Spinning GEAR's pointer first.

168
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,010
This...

169
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,480
This is the time when you go out to have fun with Enjo Retto.

170
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,610
Anno made the suit out of my fur/hair.

171
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,980
Try it on. What's the function of the suit?

172
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,740
It can increase H-energe and it has H-energe resistance.

173
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,910
That is to say...

174
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,210
That won't get torn again.

175
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,430
Thank you very much.

176
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,460
Although the funds will be allocated to us, it is still very troublesome.

177
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,880
Yes, you're right.

178
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,100
And even if you find the suitable underwear as expected,

179
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,920
It'll break all at once.

180
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,510
Really poor cost performance.

181
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,800
Could it be that...

182
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,880
uncle did it for...

183
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
Enjo

184
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,510
Yes

185
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,120
Yes... I know.

186
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,970
Is it the call from the head office?

187
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,770
What did they say?

188
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,650
The people in the department said they don't know the details either.

189
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,660
Besides, they said...

190
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,120
We are in dangerous right now.

191
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,920
What does it mean?

192
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,500
I don't know.

193
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,540
But

194
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,040
The dorm may be closed because of this matter.

195
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,170
They want us to take XERO GEAR home right now.

196
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,040
That is...

197
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,000
HXEROS…

198
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,370
HXEROS's being disbanded for now.

199
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,060
Feminization Worm.

200
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,890
Would you want me to turn your "roots" into weasels?

201
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,710
A week later.

202
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,860
Brother.

203
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,570
So you're living at home now, huh?

204
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,790
But I didn't expect that.

205
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,910
You are barred from entering the dorm.

206
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,790
You're not going to watch girls take a bath?

207
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,830
What? That's not funny.

208
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,660
You'd better go and take a shower.

209
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,340
I'm still not feeling it.

210
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,640
It unexpected that uncle's...

211
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,760
I can't believe our HXEROS will be disbanded.

212
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,230
You're almost late, but you're really taking your time.

213
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,160
You don't have the decency to talk about me.

214
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,490
After all, these happened a while ago.

215
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,120
That's why I'm getting less motivated.

216
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,500
But on the other hand,

217
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,640
we finally don't have to help with those kinds of heroic activities.

218
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,510
Just think optimistically.

219
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,960
However...

220
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,890
None of us participated in club activities.

221
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,850
We should enjoy our high school life.

222
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,370
What do you mean?

223
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,510
So

224
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,960
Let me take care of this first.

225
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,720
As long as Enjo can enjoy his nice high school life.

226
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,880
I will return it to you.

227
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,690
Fireworks convention?

228
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,240
It's about Fireworks convention time already.

229
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,990
I want to talk with you about something.

230
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,660
Oh, I see.

231
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,290
You want to invite Enjo's friends to attend the fireworks convention?

232
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,580
So you want me to invite Enjo, so he can bring his friends together?

233
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,130
But surprise that

234
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,350
Yang Xiang develops interest for Date.

235
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,930
So what?

236
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,120
Kirara and Enjo are still very close these days.

237
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,070
See, you are so well-tied, I just...

238
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,100
I don't know what to do with you.

239
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,000
You owe me a favor.

240
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,440
Thanks, Kirara.

241
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,190
Yes, that's it.

242
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,480
This moment has finally arrived.

243
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,240
Without HXEROS, there is no Kisei Chuu , and there is no H-energe.

244
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,530
And all that high school stuff didn't make sense.

245
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,580
That's just the way it is.

246
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,910
Please save me the weekend schedule first.

247
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,320
Hey, Hoshino.

248
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,080
Are you inviting me reluctantly？

249
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,640
I'm not trying to force myself to do that.

250
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,780
So do you want to attend or not?

251
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,960
I want to...

252
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,850
You're too slow, Kirara.

253
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,560
Sorry, too sorry.

254
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,310
Thank you all for waiting.

255
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,310
Kirara you also come in a yukata, too.

256
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,770
Date, where's Enjo?

257
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,280
That boy?

258
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,200
He just said that he was needed by his part-time job.

259
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,530
So he'll be here later.

260
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,780
A part-time job?

261
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,970
Special Apricot Candy

262
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,380
Thank you for your coming. Please pick one.

263
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,660
Give it to me.

264
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,420
A pity for there's one only.

265
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh... you are so unlucky.

266
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,840
Why did you pick without permission?

267
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,460
I think I will success.

268
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,300
Kirara

269
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,680
Do they have something?

270
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,520
Who knows?

271
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,480
May be somewhere we don't know

272
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,890
something happened

273
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,520
Interesting that

274
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,400
The two people who are arguing every day are so intimate.

275
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,730
Don't talk about others.

276
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,180
You've suddenly become very close to Enjo.

277
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,310
Because we were childhood friends.

278
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,150
But then again...

279
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,240
It's a good chance to come to see fireworks display.

280
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,580
What the hell is that guy doing?

281
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,470
I'm gonna go to the toilet.

282
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,420
Sorry to be late.

283
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,780
I just arrived here too.

284
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,710
I mistook the masked man for Kisei Chuu for a second.

285
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,220
It's an occupational hazard, isn't it?

286
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,040
So many people.

287
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,980
There's nothing we can do.

288
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,320
God, forgive me.

289
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,910
Enjo

290
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,070
Hoshino

291
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,680
Are you OK?

292
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,740
Why are you still here?

293
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,460
I encountered Kisei Chuu on my way here.

294
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,630
As expected, I wanted to defeat her, but this is what happened.

295
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,550
Oh no.

296
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,670
Can't you behave yourself at a rare fireworks event?

297
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,340
What?

298
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,590
I'm still looking forward to it.

299
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,040
Sorry.

300
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,040
It's my fault for forgetting that there is no XERO GEAR.

301
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,870
And still trying to battle with her.

302
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,340
Sorry. It's my fault.

303
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,900
Don't worry about it.

304
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,270
Since today's a fireworks show, there's lots of people.

305
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,070
Kisei Chuu won't miss this opportunity, right?

306
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,590
Hoshino

307
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,320
Do you know where the fireworks are set?

308
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,860
I think it would be there.

309
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:22,620
Really?

310
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,420
Wait. What's going on?

311
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,520
That guy!

312
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,210
Come to attack here.

313
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:39,790
It's OK with them.

314
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,560
They just faint for H-energy was sucked away.

315
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,730
Enjo, look!

316
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,480
According to the previous information we heard before,

317
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,860
it's just launching this kind of gunpowder into the sky.

318
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,600
I don't know how it comes true that human beings in pairs.

319
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,630
Please, stop!

320
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,480
Many people have been looking forward to this day.

321
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,000
Stupid humans go with the flow of time and emotion.

322
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,460
Like this creature,

323
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,630
it's better to explode with the gunpowder.

324
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,250
So now,

325
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,840
I will shoot all the gunpowder here at the place where the humans gather.

326
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,150
NO, wait.

327
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,390
We have to do something.

328
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,930
You'll be turned against us again if you go there.

329
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,880
And we've got a ban on heroic activities from head office.

330
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,810
I haven't mentioned it to Hoshino.

331
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,020
Why did I start to blot out Kisei Chuu?

332
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,570
For the beginning

333
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,840
It's because Kisei Chuu leave you traumatized.

334
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,390
That's why I listened to my uncle's instructions.

335
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,370
To help with HXEROS activities.

336
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,950
Enjo

337
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,300
When I were HXEROS,

338
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,790
I've learned one thing.

339
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,370
What we're guarding

340
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,320
is people's love that matters.

341
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,260
If you can't protect others' love,

342
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,050
how can you protect your love?

343
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,300
Come out, Black Kirara.

344
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,230
What happened?

345
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,100
I'm surprised you invite me out on your own.

346
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,880
Whatever, I want to ask you to store the H-energy now.

347
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,030
A piece of cake.

348
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,320
Lend me your body first.

349
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,160
Enjo Retto, come here.

350
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,300
That? what's...

351
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,650
Hoshino...

352
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,270
First, I will...

353
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,400
Beat that guy.

354
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,490
Ready to go.

355
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,040
Fabulous!

356
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,670
It would be nice if Kirara also watches this elsewhere.

357
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,340
Do not stare at me always.

358
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,080
I will be embarrassed.

359
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,180
Sorry.

360
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,010
I want to return it to you. Fortunately, so I brought it here today.

361
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,920
So everyone's here.

362
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,860
We happened to meet there just now.

363
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,360
We follow the trace of the Kisei Chuu.

364
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,120
And then we all met.

365
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,630
But you seem to have solved it. That's great.

366
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,600
Should it be...

367
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,640
Is everyone still handling hero activities?

368
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,050
Why?

369
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,940
I thought everyone was the same to Kirara.

370
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,730
Unwilling to do it?

371
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,510
We will not give up being HXEROS just because of this little thing.

372
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,080
Jiji was at a loss at first.

373
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,930
But now she seems to understand the fun.

374
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,480
Please don't use such a misleading expression.

375
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,740
Well

376
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,640
Unexpectedly, my uncle would be arrested because of the new regulations set by the new governor.

377
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,360
Eh, too bad human...

378
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,470
What's the matter, Miss Tya Tya?

379
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:36,700
This human being is always catching my attention.

380
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,070
What do you mean, attention?

381
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,460
I do not know.

382
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,430
But I don't know why I feel this way.

383
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,050
Should it be...

384
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,760
Kisei Chuu who mimicked as the governor arrested our uncle.

385
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,210
And dissolve HXEROS?

386
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,310
What are you saying, Enjo Retto? !

387
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,400
But what I've said is a possibility.

388
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,980
There's only one way to confirm.

389
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,000
That is, to meet this guy.

390
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,470
SUPER HXEROS

391
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,780
