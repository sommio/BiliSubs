1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,010
Governor Iwatsu

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,500
Thanks for your speech today

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,600
Not a big deal

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,260
If you have any more questions about regulations on presentation

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,300
contact me any time

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,600
Do you mind if

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,780
we have a meal together in a while and discuss it further?

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,220
The car is waiting for me    Thanks for you invatitation

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,020
Time to say goodbye

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,160
Pardon me

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,230
Please follow that car in the front

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:33,990
OK

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,090
We're counting on you.

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,110
SUPER HXEROS

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,670
Episode12   Battle! HXEROS

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,460
That is to say

17
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,490
No Pets Allowed

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,290
Whether she is a mimic Kisei Chuu at all

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,550
can only be verified by Tya Tya

20
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,170
That's true

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,310
Even if that's the only way   verifying in the public

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,060
would be too dangerous if she is

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,760
Also no one would listen to us as well

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,040
If that's the case

25
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,650
How about just confront her

26
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,780
That may work

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,830
What's wrong Tya Tya

28
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,670
Retto

29
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,440
Am I being helpful to you all

30
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,250
HXEROS has disappeared already

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,340
But all of you still cares about me

32
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,090
and allow me to stay in your home

33
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,970
Yet I have not help anything

34
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,600
Don't say that

35
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,890
Aren't you trying right now

36
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,900
And

37
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,230
It was Tya Tya that makes it possible for us to make battle suits

38
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,040
I'm glad that I've met all of you as well

39
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,370
My pocket money...

40
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,710
Just a heads up  we would need a return trip as well

41
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,580
Anyway

42
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,710
Why would a governor live in such a remote place

43
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,460
True Strange a little bit

44
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,820
What shall we do now

45
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,920
A group of high schooler here with no plasible reason

46
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,890
sounds so suspicious in any sense

47
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,380
How about ring the bell then run

48
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,060
What if she is the real governer

49
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,170
Then let me do it

50
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,550
If I mimic myself and contact her

51
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,150
then we won’t be suspected

52
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,080
That's too dangerous

53
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,240
She may be our enemy

54
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,310
How can we let Tya Tya go there alone

55
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,150
Even if you say that

56
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,740
I still want to help

57
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,290
You guys give me a home for me I'm no longer alone

58
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,710
The thinking of returning home

59
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,790
gives me a reason to make efforts

60
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,980
Tya Tya

61
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,090
Moreover

62
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,090
even if something went wrong

63
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,420
I belive that you guys will save me

64
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,550
Of course

65
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,380
We have a deal

66
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,100
Listen Tya Tya

67
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,740
Your mission is simple

68
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,020
Get into the governer's house

69
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,400
and examine whether there's trace of Kisei Chuu

70
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,440
If there's no problem    just come back directly

71
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,050
What if she is Kisei Chuu

72
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,300
We would come together and save you

73
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,320
Just keep running in that case

74
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,250
No problem    I can do it

75
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,340
You…You have a package

76
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,450
Is she okay?

77
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,940
Her acting is kind of…

78
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,670
Yes

79
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,710
This is she

80
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,300
What is it

81
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,350
Is she the governer

82
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,770
I'd rather call her pervert than governer

83
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,190
Sign…Sign this for me please

84
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,230
What happened to Tya Tya

85
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,450
What is she doing

86
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,740
Shirayuki

87
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,100
Please wait me there

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,820
Oh My

89
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,300
You know it's dangerous

90
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,380
Strange Where did they go

91
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,380
Is it okay for us to come in this way

92
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,040
The door is open anyway

93
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,510
And we are looking for someone It would excuse us

94
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,910
Tya Tya

95
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,030
You have come back

96
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,330
My cute dear daughter

97
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,810
And

98
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,910
You've prepared a exquisite gift like this

99
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,170
I'm delighted

100
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,250
Come Let us have food together

101
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,670
What is this on earth

102
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,220
Did she just call Tya Tya her daughter

103
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,750
Namely

104
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,220
She is the queen of Kisei Chuu

105
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,590
I did not expect to see you so soon

106
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,710
Anyway You guys managed to…

107
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,520
Save my locked kid from the nest

108
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,360
Run Tya Tya

109
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,360
I'm gonna beat her

110
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,430
It's fine

111
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,290
I'm not going to hurt your friends Take it easy

112
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,460
I would just keep them here

113
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,790
By the way

114
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,630
This room is build by Energe-H proof materials

115
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,430
You would not find a way out

116
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,520
Just stay here and save your Energe-H

117
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,090
Really It won't open

118
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,310
Same this side

119
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,930
I can't believe Tya Tya betrayed us

120
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,410
That's impossible

121
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,660
Sorry Maihima

122
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,500
I don’t mean to  say that

123
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:16,830
I'm the one who should appologize

124
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,170
But

125
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,620
Tya Tya looks different from usual    which gets my attention

126
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,670
Anyway

127
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,400
We have to get out of here first

128
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,390
How about it

129
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,330
The food of this planet taste good as well

130
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,660
Anyway Those humans get so scared

131
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,900
Surely they won't know

132
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,820
I have the ability to control all Kisei Chuu

133
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,630
What's wrong

134
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,530
You are not eating

135
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,080
I don’t have to

136
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,000
That’s true You are right

137
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,120
We should not eat these kind of things

138
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,470
Yet Don't worry

139
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,220
I will prepare a feeding farm for you

140
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,050
Using those humans

141
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,760
I have noticed

142
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,600
If we want to extinguish humans

143
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,460
We'll have to go all over this planet

144
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,410
So I need to catch a few humans with High Energe-H and take them in prison

145
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,210
to gain Energe-H continuously

146
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,280
Like riase livestock

147
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,250
That kind of thing   I'm not going to let it happen

148
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,760
No way

149
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:51,770
It's true that Energe-H won't work on this room

150
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,220
Hell

151
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,700
This place is out of the communication circle

152
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,080
Are we  runing out of ideas

153
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,680
No  We still have one more

154
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,150
Whatever it is

155
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,590
a way taken as a taboo of Saitama branch for a long time

156
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,000
To be able to use it, you have to have a sense of consciousness.

157
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,320
Are   Are you saying

158
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,700
No  We can't use it

159
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,250
What are you saying Enjo

160
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,840
It's emergent

161
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,740
If that's the only way

162
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:21,930
Then we have to do it

163
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,330
So

164
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,810
What is the idea you are talking about

165
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,260
That is

166
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,330
On the premsie of mutal consent

167
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,110
Do some erotic things

168
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,970
What   What are you talking about

169
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,720
If we want to break the wall

170
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,680
We have to wield more power than their expectation

171
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,700
Shirayuki Please help me stop her

172
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,750
That's the only way

173
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,310
Since I can't

174
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,610
believe that Tya Tya is a turncoat

175
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,650
I think there must be a reason

176
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,160
To examine the truth

177
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,490
We'll have to leave here as soon as possible

178
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,730
A room that requires you to do erotic things

179
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,080
That's the matter  A good reference

180
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,460
Even Sora are like this

181
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,170
Don't say you would do anything

182
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,830
It's true

183
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,610
What should I do

184
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,610
If it goes this way

185
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,770
Every one would be Enjo's victim

186
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,280
If we let Enjo get Energe-H using that way

187
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,470
I'm gonna get vicious

188
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,580
So

189
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,220
Everyone listen to me

190
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,660
I think this kind of thing

191
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,020
should only be done with your lover

192
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,650
In my view, this way

193
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:34,940
would be easier to make Energe-H stronger

194
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,810
So

195
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,870
In the dark room where none of us is recognizable

196
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,830
and produce Energe-H using our own imagination

197
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,870
This is my condition

198
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,980
I have a question

199
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,480
It sounds like

200
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,170
I have to attend as…

201
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,670
Eventually Kirara gets motivated

202
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,390
Don’t mess it up

203
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,610
My name is Iwazu Mokana 17 years old

204
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,570
Has it

205
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,400
started already

206
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,610
From the size of this boob…

207
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,160
the small boob to judge

208
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,390
is it Taoyuan

209
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,250
This kind of feeling

210
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,370
Looks like I'm getting lucky

211
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,920
wait…

212
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,380
What the hell is Taoyuan doing

213
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,380
It wouldn't end well this way

214
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,050
Where did Enjo go

215
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,100
Got you

216
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,890
Why it feels so soft

217
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,020
Not Enjo at all

218
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,230
Don't   Chiya…

219
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,700
Who

220
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,720
Finally

221
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,490
Anyway I have to get dressed first

222
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,410
if I try carefully I should be able to see something

223
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,410
Well Nothing

224
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,430
What happened

225
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,720
There's a warm breath near my butt

226
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,420
If eyes won’t work   how about nose

227
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,390
Well still don’t work

228
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,560
Guess I have to grope

229
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,020
Wait a minute

230
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,900
can you stop touching your armpit and make noise

231
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,640
Since you are not trying to get Energe-H

232
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,040
I'm showing you how to do it

233
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,450
It's none of your business

234
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,630
Don't say that

235
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,740
It's a good chance here

236
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,900
Are you going to waste it

237
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,470
If you are not moving   Perhaps Enjo would go find other girls

238
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,630
In fact I also want to…

239
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,630
No problem

240
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,630
No one would see through darkness

241
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,470
a little bit won't..

242
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,220
This feeling   is it…

243
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,340
Enjo

244
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,810
Hoshino

245
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,860
What the hell is happening

246
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,030
I think we fell into the gap between beds

247
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
Don’t keep saying   just move right now

248
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,510
That's what I'm trying to do

249
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,030
But my hands are pressed by you

250
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,500
can you move your waist first

251
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,400
I can't

252
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,620
Because of Black Kirara

253
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm being so sensitive right now

254
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,920
Hoshino

255
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,090
Sorry I was exhausted

256
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,590
I'm moving my waist now

257
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,890
Do it slowly

258
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,760
My eyes is getting used to the darkness

259
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,630
Hoshino

260
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,260
Done Pull it out

261
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,140
Why she is having a face like this

262
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,950
Seeing her like this    I…

263
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,910
I can't believe you are against your queen

264
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,790
Should I lock you up again like before

265
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,200
I'm no longer subject to your command

266
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,830
In this case, you are a mutant

267
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,670
Still, I may forgive you by now

268
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,680
Yet which side are you gonna pick

269
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,260
I am not Kisei Chuu   nor human

270
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,010
But there's one thing I can confirm

271
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,440
I am HXEROS

272
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,690
Is it so    Pity

273
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,400
HXE  RED！

274
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,990
HXE  YELLOW！

275
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,450
HXE  PINK！

276
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,200
HXE  WHITE！

277
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,370
HXE  BLUE！

278
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,000
SUPER HXEROS

279
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,670
Everyone

280
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,380
Sorry

281
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,420
I don't know why I did that

282
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,140
Great It's the right Tya Tya

283
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,900
It's fine now   We are here

284
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,590
Though I picked a soft way for you

285
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,550
I would not refuse to punish you a littlt bit

286
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,610
That's what we are going to say

287
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,570
Solar Ray

288
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,200
A bow annoying kill   The Matsuba Hit

289
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,850
Keep it real Mother

290
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:41,250
That's the reason

291
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,910
why you can break the room made of  Energe-H proof materials

292
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,230
I did let you live for the sake of being good Energe-H resources

293
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,020
Yet it seems I was wrong

294
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,250
So be it

295
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,490
What is that sound

296
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,560
This kid is said to be

297
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,980
A biological weapon made by our ancestors

298
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,900
Provide it with a glut of Energe-H     and it just get so huge

299
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,640
Go    Take them down

300
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,700
No way

301
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,370
What is this

302
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,960
Is everyone ok

303
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,890
Hell  On what earth is this

304
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,050
That kid seems already get addicted to Energe-H

305
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,170
If you let it go to the street   it would be a catastrophe

306
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,170
Try your best

307
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,310
Go and get her

308
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,570
But

309
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,640
We'll figure it out ourselves

310
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,810
No problem    We still have Energe-H left

311
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,440
Ok  I will go

312
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,940
We will come back soon

313
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,490
Pulsating Echo Gun

314
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,570
Your match is us

315
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,890
Strange It didn’t work

316
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,030
Why

317
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,270
XERO GEAR has no reaction

318
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,540
Is it absorbing our Energe-H right now

319
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,790
It feels like the trepang we fighted before

320
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,040
And

321
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,510
Just like the queen said

322
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,990
It gets larger after getting more Energe-H

323
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,720
I can't do anything against this kind of enemy

324
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,090
But as long as all of us cooperate…

325
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,140
Everyone Don’t give it up

326
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,980
What happened  I feel so hot

327
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,110
It feels I'm getting infinite Energe-H

328
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,570
And

329
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,950
It feels good

330
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,970
HXEROS Erotic State

331
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,280
What happened just now

332
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,760
I can't believe Energe-H could be so powerful that even XERO battle suit can not hold it

333
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,420
Counting on you

334
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,530
Enjo    Hoshino

335
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,810
Hoshino

336
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,690
I'm sorry for

337
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,900
doing that kind of thing to you

338
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,900
Right

339
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,700
I guess dropping from bed is on purpose as well

340
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,660
That' s why I appologize

341
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,790
And both of us had feelings

342
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,310
Don't be so straightforward on these kind of things

343
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,810
Sorry

344
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,920
It surprises me

345
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,420
that you act alone

346
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,470
What have you done

347
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,100
My power

348
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,350
is to controll all the Kisei Chuu at my will

349
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,690
as well as those who accecpted my blood

350
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,520
What does it mean

351
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,520
Strange I can't control my body

352
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,570
Are you okay Hoshino

353
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,080
Hoshino

354
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,790
What are you doing    Black Kirara

355
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,260
And why I am being controlled

356
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,170
That will work

357
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,710
You have killed many siblings of mine

358
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,670
I have to get these new and powerful Energe-H

359
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,280
and lay more eggs

360
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,930
I don’t feel well…

361
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,260
Looks like you cannot resist

362
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,840
Is this the limit of human nature

363
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,020
What do you say now

364
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,840
Wanna be my livestock now?

365
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,970
Is there any way to make her normal

366
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,600
keep it like this and I will…

367
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,180
Think carefully

368
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,950
I've been always with her

369
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,700
The weakness of Hoshino is…

370
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,870
No…we can't do that.

371
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,000
I can't sense Energe-H this way

372
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,590
The merit of Hoshino

373
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,710
is that she never take her charming advantage

374
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,180
Enjo What are you saying

375
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,680
I thought I hate her strong and stubborn character

376
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,320
Yet I found I cannot resist her style

377
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,890
As a serious girl

378
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,430
she still decide to join HXEROS even with complains

379
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,350
It's good to see her blushes

380
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,190
And

381
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,650
since she is this kind of person

382
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,530
That makes her simile more splendid

383
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,840
So as of me

384
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,270
comparing to the past

385
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,510
I'd love the current Hoshino more…

386
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,570
At a time like this

387
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,120
What the hell are you saying  Asshole

388
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,830
Finally You come back

389
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,810
This is your style

390
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,090
You are being too rude

391
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,100
Let's do it Hoshino

392
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,430
Defeat her by our force

393
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,350
Trivial livestock

394
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,850
How dare you hamper my lunch

395
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,110
I will end you with this

396
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,110
This feeling   I have recalled

397
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,680
The first day in the battle

398
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,170
I've never

399
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,050
seen so amazing Energe-H

400
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,640
Tempting

401
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,140
The synergy of two Energe-H produces

402
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,460
compounding Energe-H    and it is so tasty

403
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,240
This is the kind of H energy we've dreamed of…

404
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,580
Is this the end of our battle

405
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,580
It must be

406
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,790
So Hoshino

407
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,750
Is your promise still vaild

408
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,420
You've said after defeating all the Kisei Chuu

409
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,920
You will give me a response

410
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,460
I will answer you at that time

411
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,000
Why are you asking at a time like this

412
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,890
What is a time like this

413
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,100
The only reason for me to hold out till now

414
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,550
is  the spiritual support like this

415
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,770
There still are many Kisei Chuu left in other places

416
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,650
Let's talk after taking them down

417
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,610
So be it

418
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:27,470
Why are you laughing

419
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,950
Because as long as I can see you blushes

420
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,500
It feels fine

421
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,780
I don’t want to be heroe any more

422
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,360
Several days later

423
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,640
I was think what would happen

424
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,760
My fame has finally been cleared

425
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,100
HXEROS has managed to assemble again

426
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,640
I'm still going to expecting you in the future

427
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,770
to improve XERO battle suits

428
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,880
I'll help

429
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,650
Counting on you

430
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,490
What What

431
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,040
Did you use up your Energe-H

432
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,390
Come

433
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,270
Wait a minute

434
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,620
Don’t do this Momoka
