1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,080
I have to say that

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,080
what I did just now

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,210
was to make a joke with you.

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,840
I like Hoshino whatever she becomes.

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,230
Nai Xi

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,970
That wasn't my style.

7
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,010
Oh, really?

8
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,680
I think you are as cute as usual.

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,050
I should become more frank.

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,760
Kirara, let's do stretch exercise.

11
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,690
SUPER HXEROS

12
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,300
Episode 8 [H-Energy Monster]

13
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,970
Kirara, we're going.

14
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,200
Do up your coat so high.

15
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,040
Boys won't like it.

16
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,190
Not long ago,

17
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,650
I started to have some kind of hallucination.

18
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,490
Judged from the appearance, it is a moth.

19
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,700
However, it is as annoying as a fly.

20
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,130
I have no idea whether it is caused by that.

21
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,420
As to the hallucination

22
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,720
Here you come again, Black Kirara.

23
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,260
You finally talk to me.

24
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,770
I don't know why.

25
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,830
At first, I see myself when I was young in my dream.

26
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,650
Recently, it turns into hallucination and bothers me from time to time.

27
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,110
However,

28
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,310
Black Kirara sounds like a monster

29
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,320
not cute at all.

30
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,580
Can you change a more lovely name?

31
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,950
You are me in the black history, so your name is Black Kirara.

32
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,830
This name suits you well.

33
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,250
Just forget about it.

34
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,670
What is wrong with your outfit?

35
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,960
I dress as a devil to abet man to do evil things.

36
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,220
I feel embarrassed to dress in such way.

37
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,890
Although you say this,

38
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,560
I am your deep psychology repressed for a long  time in the past.

39
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,770
Now that I dress in this way,

40
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,690
that means you have an interest in this.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,440
I'm done with you.

42
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,240
Wait a minute.

43
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,320
What's up?

44
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,600
I told you

45
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,700
Go away.

46
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,970
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,120
Enjo

48
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,170
So I called you just now.

49
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,690
No wonder.

50
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,840
You must accumulate a lot of pressure.

51
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,780
No. Just now, I don't mean it.

52
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,940
OK, you need to show your sincerity.

53
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,140
Are you OK, Hoshino?

54
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,770
What is wrong? You seem weird.

55
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,610
I'm fine.

56
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,490
So boring.

57
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,950
Why not fall harder?

58
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,330
Or I need to make a demonstration.

59
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,980
No.

60
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,000
What does it mean?

61
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,430
Look what you have done. I hate you.

62
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,980
I did nothing just now.

63
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,100
I'm just a hallucination and can't touch you.

64
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,400
You may think I pushed you just now.

65
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,480
However,

66
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,730
You fall onto Enjo Retto of your own accord.

67
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,800
Those intimate accidents may be

68
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,610
caused unconsciously by you.

69
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,700
How could that be?

70
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,250
Kirara must be under a lot of pressure.

71
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,960
What is wrong with Hoshino?

72
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,820
You are from Tokyo branch.

73
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,100
I finally find you, Enjo Retto.

74
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
Excuse me for a minute and talk to me.

75
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,080
What is your aim to look for me?

76
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,040
If you look for Tya Tya, she is not here.

77
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,070
Emm…sorry to kick you a while ago

78
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,650
Never mind.

79
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,160
Then that

80
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,280
Is that girl with golden hair your girlfriend?

81
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,800
Golden hair girl?

82
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,250
Didn’t you work together before?

83
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,000
She is from Saitama branch …

84
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,860
You mean Hoshino?

85
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,050
She is not my girlfriend.

86
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,330
What? It turns out that you were dumped by her.

87
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,720
It scared me.

88
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,640
Then let me comfort you.

89
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,030
Do you wanna see my underwear?

90
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,540
No

91
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,140
But that's just fine.

92
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,440
You can be my H friend.

93
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,340
H friend?

94
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,630
Didn't Saitama say that?

95
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,530
The H friend

96
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,380
helps each other to save H-Energy

97
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,900
Here you are.

98
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,120
I have typed my contact information in it.

99
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,130
When did you … my phone?

100
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,390
Bye.

101
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,710
Finally you are still exposed.

102
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,680
I'm Shiko.

103
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,720
Sorry to take up your time.

104
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,140
Can I contact with you again next time you have time?

105
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,260
Unexpectedly she behaves so politely.

106
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,190
Is that the person from Tokyo branch?

107
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,450
This is what I buy today. Does it fit me?

108
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,030
I have no idea whether it is cute.

109
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,540
But

110
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,750
is that sexy enough for him?

111
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,260
If we use the thing that is easier to feel H-Energy,

112
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,000
whether or not we send the picture

113
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,770
such things

114
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,270
Shiko.

115
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,070
Dinner is ready. Come here.

116
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,150
I'll be right there.

117
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,220
Wait a moment.

118
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,180
Read.

119
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,510
You are stolen.

120
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,050
I feel angry.

121
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,160
Morning.

122
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,610
Good morning, Cong Yu.

123
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,710
Here you are.

124
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,510
I put many ingredients used to increase energy in it.

125
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,560
You should also try hard to combat the Kisei Chuu.

126
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,500
Thank you.

127
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,450
By now why are you still so shy?

128
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,610
We have done more embarrassing things.

129
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,920
Enjo is a part of our group.

130
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,360
Could you please not behave like getting my people?

131
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,840
What are you doing?

132
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,120
You are not Enjo Retto's girlfriend.

133
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,010
You dress conservatively,

134
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,310
so you can't be his H friend.

135
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,630
H friend?

136
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,430
Excuse me?

137
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,230
Without him, I can't feel H-Energy now.

138
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,610
What does it mean？

139
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,590
See you next time, you two guys.

140
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,880
So delicious.

141
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,620
Unexpected competitors appear.

142
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,850
Bride cuisine

143
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,100
The magazine you read is so interesting.

144
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,100
So noisy.

145
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,460
However, now that you live together,

146
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,100
that is good for you.

147
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,060
And you can use a trick.

148
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,370
Trick?

149
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,920
You just need to push him down.

150
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,320
Enjo Retto is so incapable.

151
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,450
Without this, he can do nothing.

152
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,580
What about it?

153
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,700
How does it feel to be suppressed by the power of a girl?

154
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,540
OK. Fighting, fighting.

155
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,320
If he still makes no resistance,

156
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,070
I will have sex with Enjo Retto.

157
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,390
I feel…even when I imagine it.

158
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,970
You've done it unconsciously.

159
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,310
And

160
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,350
Enjo Retto seems to be taking a shower.

161
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,690
Are you a girl if you still don't take action?

162
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,440
Is that good?

163
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,650
Continue like this, Enjo Retto will be with other girls.

164
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,240
OK, I know it.

165
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,530
But

166
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,200
I can't force him to do it.

167
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,030
I can just pretend to walk into the bathroom without knowing his presence.

168
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,670
Let me take a shower today.

169
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,380
Don't move.

170
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,640
Let me grab a bite.

171
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,010
I told you you can't do it again.

172
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,180
Wait… you

173
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,630
Wait a moment, you are …

174
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,120
What on earth are you doing?

175
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,930
Run away, Kirara

176
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,750
Stop.

177
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,170
No way.

178
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,760
Was there loud voice just now?

179
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,960
I don't know.

180
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,620
Probably Enjo Retto peeks into Kirara's bath

181
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,870
and he was beaten. That's where the voice comes from.

182
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,430
That's good.

183
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,060
Is that good?

184
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,510
I didn't expect you to be this kind of person, Enjo.

185
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,310
You misunderstand, Kirara.

186
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,740
That wasn't Enjo Retto's fault just now.

187
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,860
Erotic State?

188
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,410
I don't know much about details.

189
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,080
Only if I was bitten by Tya Tya,

190
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,450
it was heard that I will become super erotic without reason.

191
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,500
It seemed that I used to use it to the people in Tokyo Branch.

192
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,800
Seemingly, that is because there was an object that can supplement energy before my eyes.

193
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,980
It's a bit humiliating.

194
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,830
Do you mean this thing when you say you have the relationship with the girl?

195
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,220
And I am really sorry about that thing just now.

196
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,980
Although I have forgotten it,

197
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,770
I seem to make mistakes again.

198
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,730
In the end

199
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,690
It was my trespass that caused it.

200
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,580
Forbid.

201
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,530
You are not allowed to enter the beast mode.

202
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,240
It is so dangerous to lose mind.

203
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,080
So I say it, Tya Tya.

204
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,040
Sorry.

205
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,530
Originally, I attempt to bring out more powerful H-Energy in your body.

206
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,580
What a pity.

207
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,150
But being pushed over by Enjo Retto that loses mind

208
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,290
is not interesting.

209
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,600
Yes.

210
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,640
What did you say just now?

211
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,720
OK, Tya Tya.

212
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,330
Your hair has been dry.

213
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,480
No.

214
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,980
H-Energy beverage

215
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,780
inject eroticism into your monster

216
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,200
Do you long for power?

217
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,450
Who are you?

218
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,490
Answer me. Do you long for power?

219
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,790
Yes, I do.

220
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,500
If you long for it,

221
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,300
then follow your own physiological phenomena.

222
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,300
That's it?

223
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,900
Wait a minute.

224
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,300
You wait a minute.

225
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,760
What is the matter with you, Enjo Retto?

226
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,330
Your face is so terrible when you sleep today.

227
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,020
Don't get into the bed without consent to do the embarrassing thing.

228
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,860
What is that?

229
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,150
H-Energy beverage?

230
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,400
Shit. We are late.

231
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,820
Is there something to eat?

232
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,320
Can I take this jar?

233
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,590
Yes.

234
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,370
Good morning.

235
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,860
Why are you so happy?

236
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,040
Let me tell you

237
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,460
the group sends sample.

238
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,510
That is H-Energy beverage.

239
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,880
It is said that drinking it can promote metabolism of H-Energy.

240
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,840
It is missing. Why?

241
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,970
Enjo Retto took it just now.

242
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,220
What the hell?

243
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,310
Is that delicious?

244
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,900
Do you want to have a taste?

245
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,360
Cong Yu

246
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,580
Thanks.

247
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,950
But you really often come here.

248
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,660
I just happen to combat the Kisei Chuu

249
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,830
By the way, take a detour.

250
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,760
Don't you have no friends?

251
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,670
Of course, I have friends.

252
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,590
First, three persons from Toyko branch.

253
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,640
Then...

254
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,710
I shouldn't ask. I am so sorry.

255
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,300
So noisy. I really have other friends.

256
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,880
Here I have a H friend.

257
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,180
Why am I blushing?

258
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,270
Why is the taste of this jar of juice weird ?

259
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,770
How can you say this after drinking someone else's beverage?

260
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,610
Enjo Retto, do you wanna have a try?

261
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,300
No.

262
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,990
Just have a try.

263
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,200
This is indirect kiss.

264
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,030
What are you doing?

265
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,290
Hoshino

266
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,000
We are talking enthusiastically.

267
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,640
We are talking about the weird taste of juice.

268
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,290
You are just talking.

269
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,090
However, you must decide to do something nasty.

270
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,380
I mean seriously.

271
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,300
Would you like to try some?

272
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,930
It doesn't matter to me.

273
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,520
It tastes great.

274
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,730
Really? Wonderful.

275
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,550
By the way, I heard that

276
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,280
you join the HXEROS not long ago, don't you?

277
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,030
As a senior member, I can teach you a lesson about H-Energy.

278
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,410
I don't need your help.

279
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,330
I won't be defeated by you.

280
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,590
Interesting.

281
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,600
Then will you have a fight with me?

282
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,050
My pleasure.

283
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,510
Why do they seem to be weird?

284
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,520
Isn't it

285
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,390
caused by the jar of juice?

286
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,750
Karaoke talent.

287
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,190
Wonderful.

288
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,810
Does the fight mean Karaoke?

289
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,820
The sofa here

290
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,110
is soft. I feel comfortable to lie here.

291
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,740
I feel a little bit hot.

292
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,120
I'll get some drinks.

293
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,330
What would you like to drink?

294
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,830
I'd like a coke.

295
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,250
I'd like a strong ice tea.

296
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,420
So what are you going to compete?

297
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,880
Do you want to determine the winner by singing Karaoke?

298
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,460
You know me.

299
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,090
Now that we are HXEROS,

300
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,310
why not we compare the H-Energy?

301
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,720
This can measure the cumulant of H-Energy.

302
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,230
The person who saves more H-Energy

303
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,190
wins. What do you think?

304
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,240
OK.

305
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,260
Then let's start.

306
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,780
Fighting. Another me.

307
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,450
I am back.

308
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,370
Do I scare you?

309
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,130
Even the cosplay costumes are so well prepared in Karaoke recently.

310
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,120
Yes.

311
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,790
I advise not to sing Karaoke.

312
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,260
Anyway we are in the balcony.

313
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,230
Why not do some more interesting things?

314
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,650
No, I want to sing some songs.

315
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,010
What?

316
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,650
You mean you are more interested in the Karaoke than me.

317
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,860
I mean …

318
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:39,800
OK.

319
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,370
Then let me sing the song with you.

320
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,650
You can be closer.

321
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,410
Your face is too close.

322
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,720
That's OK.

323
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,670
We can't save H-Energy if we don't do it.

324
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,260
I'm OK.

325
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,000
One two

326
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,550
Enjo

327
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,600
Would you like to use this microphone?

328
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,240
Hoshino?

329
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,910
Come. You can sing the song.

330
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,920
How do I sing the song?

331
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:48,530
If we need to save H-Energy, we can choose to pick other things.

332
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,810
Wait a minute. I come up with that idea.

333
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,070
Is this …

334
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,320
the effect of H-Energy beverage?

335
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,830
How can I just … give in？

336
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,650
What's wrong with me just now …?

337
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,990
My head hurts.

338
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,120
This dress…

339
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,120
Is this your fault too?

340
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,160
Don't ask me.

341
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,540
This is really a tough opponent.

342
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,510
I'm really miserable today.

343
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,390
Don't you know everything?

344
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,100
That's impossible.

345
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,140
I just borrow your knowledge.

346
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,980
I can't know knowledge you don't have.

347
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,090
You've got a point.

348
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,740
I'm not your enemy.

349
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,360
Let's get along with each other.

350
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,870
No.

351
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,500
Speaking of which,

352
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,330
for what purpose did you suddenly appear before me?

353
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,060
That day

354
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,790
I really locked you in my heart.

355
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,360
My purpose

356
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,760
You really have forgotten it.

357
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,160
Our commitment on that day.

358
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,090
Commitment?

359
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,940
My purpose is to

360
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,600
let me and Enjo Retto have sex.

361
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,330
SUPER HXEROS

362
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,680
