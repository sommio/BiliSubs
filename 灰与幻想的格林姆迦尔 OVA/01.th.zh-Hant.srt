1
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,100
By the way,

2
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,660
What's wrong?

3
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,580
They're really big!

4
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,840
Hey, tell me what do you eat to get like that?

5
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,900
There's nothing special really...

6
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,480
(Hey!)
There's nothing special really...

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,070
There's nothing special really...

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:49,690
(You idiot!)

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,230
Really? But how to get that big?

10
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,570
(You really shouldn't do this.)
Really? But how to get that big?

11
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,700
(No one would do this kind of thing!)
Really? But how to get that big?

12
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,530
(I know that, obviously!)

13
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,210
(If I can achieve the goals,)

14
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,120
Good for you.
(If I can achieve the goals,)

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,090
(it doesn't matter even if I forfeit my humanity!)

16
00:00:59,090 --> 00:00:59,950
Look so good.
(it doesn't matter even if I forfeit my humanity!)

17
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,150
Look so good.
(Even if I become a demon!)

18
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,040
(Even if I become a demon!)

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,740
(You're too exaggerating, right?)

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,290
It's not like that!
(You're too exaggerating, right?)

21
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,260
It's not like that!
(Just need to be self-control...)

22
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:05,540
(Just need to be self-control...)

23
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,370
("Self-control"?)
(Just need to be self-control...)

24
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,080
("Self-control"?)

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,380
(No idea about that!)

26
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,210
(At least it's not in my dictionary...)

27
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:11,840
(Oh!)
Yume?

28
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,520
Your boobs are huge, Shihoru!

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,100
and they're cute, too.

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,920
Cute?

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,660
Yeah!

32
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,160
Is it okay if I have a feel of them?

33
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,770
(Don't hold back, Haruhiro!)

34
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:27,190
I'm just gonna touch a little bit!
(Don't hold back, Haruhiro!)

35
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,750
I'm just gonna touch a little bit!
(You've already lost to your instincts!)

36
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,690
(You've already lost to your instincts!)

37
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,690
(Otherwise, you would drag me back.)

38
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,280
(or raise your voice, right?)

39
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,210
Don't!

40
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,950
I knew it would be nice to touch them...

41
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,290
(I see...)

42
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:43,990
They're indeed amazing.
(I see...)

43
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,040
They're indeed amazing.
(I lost...)

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,360
They're indeed amazing.

45
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,500
(I lost, huh?)

46
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,390
(We lost...)

47
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:48,750
Wait!
(We lost...)

48
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,030
Wait!

49
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,250
(We...)

50
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:50,880
(You idiot! Actually...)
(We...)

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,090
(You idiot! Actually...)

52
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:52,850
(we didn't lose...we won!)

53
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,500
Wait!
(we didn't lose...we won!)

54
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:53,960
(we didn't lose...we won!)

55
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,340
(What did you say?)

56
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,090
Let me touch a bit more!
(What did you say?)

57
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,340
Let me touch a bit more!

58
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,200
Let me touch a bit more!
(Our instincts...our desires won!)

59
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,310
(Our instincts...our desires won!)

60
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,760
Please don't touch me like that!
(Our instincts...our desires won!)

61
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,600
Please don't touch me like that!
(Does it mean we lost?)

62
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,160
(NO!)

63
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,470
You're really like a little baby!
(NO!)

64
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,810
You're really like a little baby!
(We won!)

65
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,640
You're really like a little baby!
(Did I say anything wrong?)

66
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,810
You're really like a little baby!

67
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,730
(I see...)

68
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,600
That's amazing...

69
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,430
That's amazing...
(So we actually won...)

70
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,860
(So we actually won...)

71
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,230
(Without even noticing it...)

72
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,860
(and we won, huh?)

73
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,820
(But honestly, I am kinda curious.)

74
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,410
(Though I'm not really seeing anything.)

75
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,830
(I'm not gonna go and peek at least...)

76
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,250
(Of course, right?)

77
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,210
(Here are all our dreams.)

78
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,750
(Let's toast to that.)

79
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,170
(To this moment we are at)

80
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,300
(and to the meaning of being alive.)

81
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,090
(So, let the curtains for our dreams rise.)

82
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,560
It would be nice if mine are like yours, too, Yume.

83
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,210
But mine are just like this.

84
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,020
I think yours are very cute as well.

85
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,230
What? No way!

86
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,770
What do you think mines are cute?

87
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,390
They're not that overweight like mine,

88
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,850
but they seem soft.

89
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,720
But I don't think yours are overweight, Shihoru.

90
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,380
I mean, they seem soft and also seem tasty.

91
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,540
Tasty? I'm not the food, you know!

92
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,320
This is too much!

93
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,750
No, no, no!

94
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,600
What the heck are they two doing there?

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This is too bad. My mind is all over the place.

96
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,920
Wanna take a bite? Maybe like here...

97
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,400
Maybe here?

98
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,220
Hey, don't hold back!

99
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,220
But it's gonna hurt...

100
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,220
Come here!

101
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,220
I...I can't.

102
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,450
Let me go, dumbass!

103
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,590
You stupid!

104
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,860
You're the stupid one!
Don't you wanna take a look?

105
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,930
Are you gonna give up such precious chance?

106
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,680
Are you really not gonna regret it later on, huh?

107
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,290
Well...

108
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,900
I might regret it.

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,700
I can't promise that I won't.

110
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,140
But what will happen if we go beyond?

111
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,640
What do you guys think?

112
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,660
What do you mean?

113
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,100
We're already excited now.

114
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,020
It'll be dangerous.

115
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,800
And we might gone too far to save.

116
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,330
So, let's head back to the room.

117
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,250
To our room.

118
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,090
The room for four of us here.

119
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,170
I don't think

120
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,270
I can handle that well.

121
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,070
Dammit.

122
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,070
Dammit!

123
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,720
Gosh dammit!

124
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,780
That shout was for all of us, from our hearts.

125
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,310
And it cried from our souls.

126
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,760
The unsettled feelings that can't be expressed

127
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,700
with the deepest of sorrows,

128
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,600
they were all drawn into the sky,
the starry night.

129
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,580
The red moon is hanging in the sky.

130
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,410
From the first time I saw it,

131
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,300
the amazing red moon stays still.

132
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,600
With an endless, deep dark blue sky,

133
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,200
the twinkling stars,

134
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,460
they're so close that were seemingly about to fall.

135
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,800
The desires of our souls,

136
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,930
must have shaken the faraway,

137
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,560
irreplaceable horizon of the beautiful world.

138
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,070
Guys, ride on me.

139
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,470
I'm fine with it.

140
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,120
It's raining?

141
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,790
That was thunder, right?

142
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,980
We gotta go hide somewhere.

143
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,820
Impossible.

144
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,940
This's impossible.

145
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,080
This can't be possible!

146
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,720
Moguzo's resolution is strong.

147
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,730
It's too strong.

148
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,310
Can we let go of everything to do this?

149
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,390
No, we can't.

150
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,740
There's no way we can do this.

151
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,990
Maybe our thoughts made the heaven waver.

152
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,100
Our desires also touched God's heart.

153
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,500
In this case, we should only go forward,

154
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,140
and continue to go this way.

155
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,290
Thank you, Moguzo.

156
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,520
We're alive.

157
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,470
Yes, we're still alive.

158
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,600
Now we can truly feel in this way.

159
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,800
That hurts!

160
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,800
Ranta!

161
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,860
No, this's not what you...

162
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,600
How!

163
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,210
You filthy fiend!

164
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,520
T-this is an open-air bath by itself, right?

165
