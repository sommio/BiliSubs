1
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:13,426
This is Alfa 13

2
00:00:13,426 --> 00:00:14,922
The base, please answer

3
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:16,530
This is Alfa 13

4
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:18,139
The base, please answer

5
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:19,766
This is Alfa 13

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,901
This is the base. What's the current situation?

7
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:24,604
We were attacked by the enemy during the task

8
00:00:24,904 --> 00:00:27,066
Among 324 people in the Alfa troop

9
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:28,858
323 people were killed in the war

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,492
I am the only survivor

11
00:00:31,068 --> 00:00:32,108
Enemy…

12
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:35,615
Should be the Union

13
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:39,182
What's up?

14
00:00:39,183 --> 00:00:40,454
What was it just now?

15
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:42,096
The base, please answer

16
00:00:42,471 --> 00:00:43,790
This is Alfa 13

17
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,916
Please answer

18
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:56,217
Go this way. Move quickly

19
00:01:09,582 --> 00:01:10,878
Help

20
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,891
Where are you going?

21
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:21,978
Play more with me

22
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:33,549
Heck. It's not even enough to pass the time

23
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:35,989
Sorry to interrupt you

24
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:38,594
Target doesn't seem to be there

25
00:01:48,949 --> 00:01:51,357
Found it

26
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,301
Tazio

27
00:01:53,302 --> 00:01:54,807
The location of the apron was sent to you

28
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,988
It's a little far away from you. Can you rush over?

29
00:01:57,423 --> 00:01:58,364
No problem

30
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,527
Damn it

31
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:23,514
Target has been captured

32
00:02:27,853 --> 00:02:30,188
I want to say that we haven't had a big task for a long time

33
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:31,607
Just this extent

34
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:33,264
Shark, sledgehammer

35
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,627
The task doesn't exist to satisfy you

36
00:02:39,113 --> 00:02:41,991
Our Captain Kleis is here

37
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:45,792
Tazi

38
00:02:46,202 --> 00:02:46,913
Tazio

39
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:49,207
The backup force will take charge of everything here

40
00:02:49,656 --> 00:02:52,043
We will move to the next task place

41
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:54,337
Where is the next task place?

42
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:57,173
Japan

43
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,288
Something that must be guarded

44
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:45,469
I actually want to get to school early

45
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,408
This is the first time since I was born

46
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:50,732
Because the days in hospital make you feel bored

47
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:54,861
But Little Yu, you might as well take more rest

48
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:57,214
That hand of you can't copy notes

49
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:58,907
That hurts

50
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:00,515
What are you talking about?

51
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:03,495
Xue, you may as well copy it for me

52
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:06,540
I can only agree with you

53
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:11,795
Is it true or false?

54
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:13,274
It's the first time I meet him

55
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:15,257
Who's he

56
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:20,846
What's wrong

57
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:22,847
Girls' eyes are showing love

58
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:23,932
I don't know who he is

59
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:25,987
Is he the new guard?

60
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:27,853
Good morning

61
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:28,979
Good morning

62
00:05:29,672 --> 00:05:31,898
Good morning

63
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,586
Morning

64
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:37,064
Your hand

65
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:40,073
I had a car accident not long ago

66
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,745
He is always reckless

67
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:44,160
I did it to save you

68
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,329
Sorry. Sorry

69
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:52,002
Master, it seems that the memory remove was successful.

70
00:05:56,115 --> 00:05:58,216
Who the hell are you?

71
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,219
So was the couple we took out

72
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:03,805
They are obviously not ordinary humans

73
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:08,030
We belong to the organization "Union"

74
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:09,477
Union

75
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:12,522
is an organization with super-standard scientific capabilities

76
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:16,818
It can be said that we are their works

77
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,016
Having said that, I'm just an experimenter

78
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:24,264
Just for them to complete the finished product like Jack and Mary

79
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:28,330
I couldn't even do this level of things at first

80
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:30,910
However, as time goes by

81
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,911
I don't know why only M-24 and I

82
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:35,253
have completed the special evolution

83
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,838
Well

84
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,049
compared to the finished product

85
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:41,051
We are like scrap metal

86
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:44,262
The experimenters like you

87
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:45,997
So many people

88
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,183
have passed away

89
00:06:49,684 --> 00:06:51,770
I am the only one who survives

90
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:55,897
I couldn't even save M-24

91
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:00,487
What do you plan to do in the future

92
00:07:01,575 --> 00:07:03,001
If you have nowhere to go

93
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:04,469
You can live here

94
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:06,701
You rebelled against the organization

95
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,168
If you are found alive, you may be killed by the organization

96
00:07:10,582 --> 00:07:11,958
What's your attempt

97
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:15,168
You protected my students

98
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:18,588
They were only slightly injured

99
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:20,659
It was because of you and your friends

100
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,000
Of course, if you want to leave, you can go

101
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:26,931
I have no plan to lock you up

102
00:07:26,932 --> 00:07:28,113
Is what you said true?

103
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:30,754
You trust others so easily

104
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,771
But I'm not as kind as you

105
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:37,566
Things like trust are not important

106
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:41,403
Only master's decisions are important

107
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,366
But this is not for you to benefit for no reason

108
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:50,579
It's just that I'm looking to increase my staff

109
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,293
Frank

110
00:07:56,938 --> 00:07:58,354
Yes, master

111
00:07:58,808 --> 00:07:59,963
I'm going to school

112
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:01,506
Give me that

113
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,883
Could it be that…

114
00:08:02,884 --> 00:08:06,576
Will the master intend to practice what I taught him last night

115
00:08:15,015 --> 00:08:16,073
Good morning

116
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:17,695
Hi, long time no see

117
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:19,696
Well, catch him

118
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:21,694
Wait, what are you doing?

119
00:08:21,695 --> 00:08:22,968
Come on

120
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:26,221
Look over there

121
00:08:26,997 --> 00:08:28,867
It's Leggiero

122
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:31,077
He's so handsome

123
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:36,518
Good morning, Lai

124
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,210
Long time no see

125
00:08:38,844 --> 00:08:40,388
How are you recently?

126
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:42,012
(Fractured man, satyr, fool)

127
00:08:44,606 --> 00:08:45,592
What's wrong?

128
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:47,928
Do you think this is rare?

129
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:53,516
Does Lai want it?

130
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,992
Sure enough, this would make people want to doodle

131
00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:58,855
What the hell is it?

132
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:01,066
Don't doodle

133
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,227
Really? this is so cute

134
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,861
This is not cute

135
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:07,789
Little Yu's face is fierce. So it's really six of one and half a dozen of the other

136
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:09,115
What's your meaning?

137
00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:16,790
You don’t know if the host is still having fun?

138
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,591
You little Yu

139
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:27,801
You can’t use your mobile phone in class

140
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,894
Lai, don't you eat it?

141
00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:39,713
I'm waiting for it to expand

142
00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:41,189
Why are you here again?

143
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:43,358
What does it matter?

144
00:09:43,854 --> 00:09:46,695
I just play with my friends for a little while, and then I will go back home

145
00:09:47,697 --> 00:09:49,447
OK, see you

146
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:53,410
See you tomorrow. Bye

147
00:09:54,712 --> 00:09:55,996
It finally came to an end

148
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,541
Xue, did you buy the one published before?

149
00:09:58,542 --> 00:09:59,544
Game?

150
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,001
I bought it

151
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:02,127
Fantastic

152
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:04,213
We must pass the game

153
00:10:04,214 --> 00:10:06,571
You still want to play with your hands like this?

154
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,471
Lai, if you are free, do you want to come to my house together?

155
00:10:10,472 --> 00:10:11,913
It's a good idea

156
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:14,681
But you are weak in playing games

157
00:10:15,098 --> 00:10:16,766
I'll give you special training

158
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:19,520
What's wrong with you?

159
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:20,855
Isn't is convenient?

160
00:10:21,882 --> 00:10:24,316
You live in the chairman's house, right?

161
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:26,319
Right

162
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,322
If you go to other places without explaining, the chairman will worry, right?

163
00:10:29,323 --> 00:10:31,482
And you don't have that

164
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:32,532
You are right

165
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:38,580
How did you feel on the first day at work?

166
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:41,124
Nothing special

167
00:10:41,313 --> 00:10:45,433
I just provide labor in exchange for food and lodging

168
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:48,965
And I don’t know how long it will last

169
00:10:50,103 --> 00:10:51,092
Really?

170
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:58,558
Frank

171
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:01,645
This world really changed

172
00:11:02,158 --> 00:11:05,274
Master, because the time you slept

173
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:07,567
is too long

174
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:11,112
The humans are fantastic

175
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:14,616
Those kids have things I don't have

176
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:17,464
They said

177
00:11:17,465 --> 00:11:18,955
If I have that thing

178
00:11:18,956 --> 00:11:22,082
I can do more

179
00:11:22,855 --> 00:11:25,396
I will not go the wrong way

180
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:27,963
Occasionally, I can make a long detour sometimes.

181
00:11:29,115 --> 00:11:31,758
And we can play game if we have that thing

182
00:11:32,113 --> 00:11:34,469
Master, are you talking about the cell phone?

183
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:38,391
I'm very sorry

184
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:40,767
I will prepare it for you immediately

185
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:51,331
Good morning

186
00:11:51,957 --> 00:11:53,125
Good morning, man

187
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:54,584
Man

188
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:56,711
Hope you work well

189
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,421
Bye, man

190
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,740
Lai, good morning.

191
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,450
Is this the cell phone?

192
00:12:09,451 --> 00:12:10,934
Does Lai have a cell phone?

193
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:12,936
This is the latest model

194
00:12:13,353 --> 00:12:16,607
Then you don't need to answer the phone through the chairman

195
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:18,870
Tell the phone number to me

196
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:22,053
Don't you know the phone number?

197
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:24,688
Then it's my turn

198
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,284
Lai, lend me your cell phone

199
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,414
I will teach you how to become a master of smartphones

200
00:12:33,394 --> 00:12:34,667
First, like this.

201
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:36,073
And then, like that.

202
00:12:36,074 --> 00:12:39,597
Xue, send my number and mailbox address

203
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:42,633
This is called email

204
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:43,781
As long as you do this

205
00:12:43,782 --> 00:12:47,721
You can use emoticons and kaomoji etc.

206
00:12:51,808 --> 00:12:52,726
(The prisoner held explosives and committed suicide while fleeing)

207
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:54,394
(The Metropolitan Police Department has not yet announced it)The data has been falsified

208
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,733
Did Union do it?

209
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:03,281
Yes, master

210
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:09,250
(Frank, you have had a long day, master) I felt this email not quite right…

211
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:22,923
It's just you

212
00:13:23,924 --> 00:13:27,761
A newcomer to the special security department

213
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:30,706
Now that it was the person brought by the chairman

214
00:13:30,707 --> 00:13:32,974
You must be a good guy

215
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:37,270
Is that guy so trusted

216
00:13:38,313 --> 00:13:43,486
At least he is the person who founded this school

217
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:46,530
Here is a good place

218
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:50,784
A good place, really?

219
00:14:05,134 --> 00:14:06,342
Is it true or false

220
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:07,968
Go and have a look

221
00:14:10,311 --> 00:14:11,388
What's going on

222
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:17,978
Isn't it this guy?

223
00:14:18,632 --> 00:14:21,357
Hey, here is a kid in red hair

224
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:22,196
Come out quickly

225
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:24,401
You are so cute

226
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,486
Let go of me

227
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:28,905
I'm gonna make your friend cry

228
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:31,659
Hurry up and bring people to me

229
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,370
I can't show up because I am staying away from trouble

230
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:35,912
Don't get me into trouble

231
00:14:35,913 --> 00:14:39,138
Newcomer, please report quickly

232
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:41,429
Sorry, send some people to support

233
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,420
I can't move now

234
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:43,461
Let go of that kid

235
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:46,102
No vehicles are allowed in or out here

236
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,011
Vehicles in and out in other places

237
00:14:51,336 --> 00:14:52,846
Could you move your car

238
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,227
Please leave

239
00:14:59,228 --> 00:15:00,604
Here is the school

240
00:15:00,605 --> 00:15:01,483
The kids will...

241
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,772
That's it

242
00:15:08,936 --> 00:15:10,156
Is it you?

243
00:15:10,157 --> 00:15:12,407
A brat who bothers other people's women

244
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:14,410
Little Yu

245
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:17,329
Did you do anything to that woman?

246
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,336
Before I met you this morning

247
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:28,757
Dangerous

248
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:31,968
Are you all right

249
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,223
That's all

250
00:15:36,723 --> 00:15:38,308
Please say something good for me

251
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,894
Hey, man

252
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:45,066
Don't be so angry with such trivial things

253
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:46,816
OK?

254
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:48,276
Think of your age

255
00:15:51,238 --> 00:15:53,657
What are you doing, man?

256
00:15:53,657 --> 00:15:57,774
Just let him remember that it can never do anything bad again

257
00:15:59,454 --> 00:16:02,666
Man, you better be a little measured

258
00:16:03,977 --> 00:16:06,795
It's too much to be jealous

259
00:16:07,682 --> 00:16:08,922
Don't be in your glory

260
00:16:08,923 --> 00:16:10,757
You are a brat

261
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:20,346
Little Yu

262
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:29,067
Why do you look at me with that look in your eyes?

263
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:30,944
Is he instigating me?

264
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,262
Are you kidding

265
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,389
I can't go over and make things complicated

266
00:16:54,283 --> 00:16:55,427
Great

267
00:16:56,243 --> 00:16:58,388
I will no longer be merciful

268
00:16:58,666 --> 00:16:59,931
I will kill you

269
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:06,646
Little Yu

270
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,651
Don't be violent against students

271
00:17:15,224 --> 00:17:16,323
The janitor

272
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:20,160
There is no good end being a good guy

273
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:21,193
Let go of him

274
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,639
Man

275
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:31,046
Here is another yes-man

276
00:17:31,504 --> 00:17:33,131
Do you want me to repeat this word several times?

277
00:17:33,757 --> 00:17:35,258
I told you to let go of him

278
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:38,803
Man, go aside

279
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:48,813
You guy

280
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:53,568
How can it be?

281
00:17:54,776 --> 00:17:56,488
You actually didn't move

282
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,403
If no one else was watching

283
00:18:13,996 --> 00:18:15,757
you would have died long ago

284
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:19,553
Both of you, hurry up and go

285
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,347
Man

286
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:25,392
Thank you, man

287
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,143
You are terribly strong

288
00:18:27,144 --> 00:18:28,354
You were really good just now

289
00:18:28,355 --> 00:18:29,438
So gorgeous

290
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:30,341
Are you practicing pedro fleitas?

291
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,103
That's awesome

292
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:53,378
We were born in a transparent glass tube

293
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:56,214
and didn't make much contribution since birth

294
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,924
Our bodies were exposed

295
00:18:57,924 --> 00:18:58,925
and our blood was drawn

296
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:00,802
Our lives were discarded after being utilized

297
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:03,638
It was finally useful

298
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:06,433
But we even don't have a formal name

299
00:19:07,027 --> 00:19:10,812
We were the only people who have survived to identify with ourselves

300
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,859
Everyone desperately wanted to survive

301
00:19:16,296 --> 00:19:19,527
Just like ordinary humans living in this city

302
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,187
We are ordinary

303
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,024
You are right

304
00:19:23,025 --> 00:19:25,160
That's life  for granted

305
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,747
Let's find our names together

306
00:19:29,956 --> 00:19:32,584
We will find our names some day

307
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:36,713
And the names of the dead partners

308
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,637
I heard about the school

309
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:46,454
Sorry, I was too rash

310
00:19:47,012 --> 00:19:50,227
I hid here with the help of your power

311
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:54,773
Remember not to kill people, and be merciful sometimes

312
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,152
Actually, I don’t need to say much

313
00:20:01,452 --> 00:20:04,407
I have one thing I must do

314
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,329
I must complete my agreement with my partner

315
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:14,918
Could I leave here?

316
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:16,127
Please

317
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,296
What are you talking about?

318
00:20:19,381 --> 00:20:22,133
I said you can stay here

319
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,310
What's your opinion?

320
00:20:33,311 --> 00:20:36,608
Master

321
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:38,567
I seem to understand the reason why you decided to let him stay here

322
00:20:43,811 --> 00:20:47,894
M-24, I must definitely fulfill the agreement

323
00:20:48,171 --> 00:20:49,369
Before that day

324
00:20:50,775 --> 00:20:54,991
I will live an ordinary and natural life with you

325
00:21:02,915 --> 00:21:04,467
Here is Japan

326
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:05,760
a big city

327
00:21:06,386 --> 00:21:08,805
Want me to make a show of strength in such a place?

328
00:21:09,222 --> 00:21:11,392
The task this time is not war

329
00:21:11,393 --> 00:21:13,254
Is it a terrorist act?

330
00:21:13,255 --> 00:21:13,977
No

331
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:17,303
The task this time is not to fight but to investigate

332
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:18,523
Investigation

333
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:23,571
Jack and Mary in charge of recycling the coffin

334
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:25,297
They cannot be contacted in this country

335
00:21:25,662 --> 00:21:26,740
They actually…

336
00:21:27,055 --> 00:21:31,912
The two failed subjects also disappeared

337
00:21:33,285 --> 00:21:37,293
I hacked into organization's computer to get this information while I was killing time

338
00:21:37,294 --> 00:21:39,688
But why did they let us investigate it

339
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,675
Is it necessary to use us for this job, reinforced for the big battle?

340
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:44,970
It doesn't matter

341
00:21:45,675 --> 00:21:48,970
We are only responsible for following the orders of the organization
