1
00:00:01,775 --> 00:00:06,477
A long time ago, there was a group of people with extraordinary powers and longevity. They used these powers to protect humans from disasters

2
00:00:06,477 --> 00:00:11,525
But they only lived quietly in the shadows, living a lonely life

3
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:16,325
They were worshipped by humans, sometimes called nobles, rulers, or gods

4
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:21,475
But seldom people knew that these nobles were also protected by a stronger one

5
00:00:21,475 --> 00:00:26,650
He was the patron saint of the nobility. We call it "the Great Nobility"

6
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:56,425
I killed his partners

7
00:00:56,425 --> 00:00:59,725
But I couldn't open the treasure chest

8
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,700
I will be there now

9
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:03,075
Oh, damn it

10
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,975
Failed to catch up

11
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,950
Are you late too

12
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,200
Is there such a handsome boy in our school?

13
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:28,875
It's strange that the door opened by itself

14
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:32,100
Where's that guy

15
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:35,325
Principal's office

16
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:55,975
Master

17
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,825
Long time no see

18
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:00,500
Frankenstein

19
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:03,175
Yes, master

20
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,300
I woke up first

21
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,300
How long has it been since then

22
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:16,675
It has been 820 years

23
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:22,475
Is this where you live

24
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:25,025
This is the former Greek lyceum

25
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,675
Now it's called school

26
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,275
It's a place to preach to students

27
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:35,075
School

28
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,600
I also have to know

29
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,250
the modern world that has changed so much

30
00:04:40,675 --> 00:04:43,575
I'll be sure to pass it all on

31
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,200
Introduce the new transfer student

32
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:52,575
Hello, May I have your name?

33
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,425
Cadiz·Aitrama·di·Legero

34
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,575
Ah, it's you. Just now...

35
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,325
It's Tashiro. Do you know him?

36
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:06,375
Then go sit next to Tashiro

37
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:15,350
what's up?

38
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,025
What? Damn it

39
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:29,775
Really, I am sure I put it here

40
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:33,500
Can I eat it

41
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,475
Do whatever you want

42
00:05:56,825 --> 00:05:59,075
It seems that this guy didn't lie

43
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:02,000
Someone moved the coffin here

44
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,500
We were going to steal it from the organization

45
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,175
I didn't expect this

46
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,800
The organization should be suspicious soon

47
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,925
We have to hurry up

48
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,000
Or we will be dangerous

49
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,850
How to deal with this guy?

50
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,900
Oh, by the way

51
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:20,150
We can find the coffin with the help of him

52
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:27,625
Here you are

53
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,325
Have you been abroad all the time?

54
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,550
Have you ever had ramen?

55
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,850
It's very delicious

56
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:41,625
Taste the punishment of stakes

57
00:06:45,475 --> 00:06:47,925
You think it's gonna work on me?

58
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,125
This is pickle

59
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,150
It's very delicious

60
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,425
Taste the punishment of garlic

61
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:02,575
Kill me with poison

62
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,350
But

63
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,050
What are you laughing at? It's going to be cool

64
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,125
More than before

65
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:12,950
It just opened up

66
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,350
Hurry up and eat

67
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,725
You really don't know anything

68
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,275
Do you know this game?

69
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,425
We can play together next time

70
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:27,300
Then let me teach you

71
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:30,550
Screams

72
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:33,700
Yu

73
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:45,952
Are you OK?

74
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:47,125
Tashiro

75
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:49,800
What did you do to Iwata

76
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:52,050
Tashiro, run away

77
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,475
Dangerous

78
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,000
What's that guy

79
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,375
Hurry up and run away

80
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,100
If you don't hurry up and run away

81
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,225
Xue, hurry up

82
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:18,750
That man

83
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:22,100
Feels unusual

84
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,600
Who's he?

85
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:34,350
What the hell is that man?

86
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,175
Is that human?

87
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,550
Thank you… everyone

88
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,175
That's all right. It's a matter of course

89
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,000
Lai, thank you too

90
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:45,475
Lai

91
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,975
We goddesses call him that way

92
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,700
Can I call you Lai?

93
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:00,000
It's up to you

94
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,525
Is it Lai?

95
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:04,425
From today onwards, Lai will be our partner.

96
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,925
Anyway, Lai, where do you live?

97
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,575
What?

98
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,925
Isn't it

99
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,250
Principal?

100
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:30,075
That girl appeared in this guy's memory

101
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,175
Since we have no clue now

102
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,025
We have to investigate that girl

103
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,650
I didn't receive the report, so I want to come here to have a look

104
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,475
What are you doing?

105
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:47,825
M24

106
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:49,375
M21

107
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,825
Jack and Mary, why are you here?

108
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:57,675
No one who was sent to investigate the coffin has been heard from

109
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,200
The organization can't be doing nothing

110
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,125
What will happen if you act without permission

111
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,800
Do you know it?

112
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,025
So here's the thing about this guy

113
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,550
He is a helper

114
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:13,575
We can track down the whereabouts of the coffin with the help with this guy

115
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:20,225
What you have done by incomplete experiments

116
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:22,300
What can I expect to do

117
00:10:22,825 --> 00:10:24,175
Forget it. Hold back

118
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:27,275
Think about it as a dog tracking the coffin

119
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:28,875
I'm leaving

120
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:36,625
Well, you'll be notified of the disciplinary action against you later

121
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:40,025
Stop being so nosy before this

122
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,400
If you don't want to die

123
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:51,900
Wait, wait a moment

124
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,425
Next time I will…

125
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:00,775
There is no "next time"

126
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,300
The Great Nobility

127
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,225
Well, next task

128
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:11,800
I am afraid that something called the "the Great Nobility" in the coffin absolutely exists

129
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:14,150
With the help of his powers

130
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,650
We should run away from the organization

131
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:21,000
But once exposed, we might be killed by Jack

132
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,825
Anyway, we will be killed sooner or later

133
00:11:24,425 --> 00:11:25,500
You are right

134
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:29,150
We mustn't let our partners die in vain

135
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,650
We must obtain the freedom that belongs to us

136
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,925
Did you hear what happened yesterday?

137
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:55,525
All the people in the hospital were killed

138
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,175
Could it be that man we saw yesterday did it ?

139
00:11:59,175 --> 00:12:00,600
It's horrible

140
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,875
Don't be afraid. I will protect you

141
00:12:03,325 --> 00:12:06,250
The whole city is starting to talk about it

142
00:12:11,525 --> 00:12:12,615
That guy Jack

143
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:16,025
took the task as an excuse, but in fact he just wanted to kill people.

144
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,925
Be calm M24

145
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,450
We can't go head-to-head with them

146
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:22,825
As long as we grab the coffin

147
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:25,175
Maybe we can win

148
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,025
Look at those kids we saw yesterday

149
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,850
What happened to that guy?

150
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,600
Have we been discovered

151
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,000
Then we can leave before Jack and others

152
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,375
You are really leisurely

153
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,950
Jack and Mary

154
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:54,925
What are you doing? Deal with it quickly

155
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:59,625
The most important thing now is to eliminate all risk factors in the organization

156
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:02,775
Those kids are witnesses, right?

157
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:16,425
Lai really can't do it at all

158
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,375
It can't be helped. It is the first time for Lai to do it

159
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,225
What's wrong, Iwata?

160
00:13:25,475 --> 00:13:29,025
Sorry, can I go back from here today?

161
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,250
It's a bit detour, but let's go

162
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,900
There is nothing important to do

163
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,475
This is really the right decision

164
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:42,300
Kids

165
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:44,825
What?

166
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:52,975
What are you planning to do?

167
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,700
There is another witness

168
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,225
We must find him first

169
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:06,675
Obviously a crap, every time it's like something.

170
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:08,600
Whatever you want

171
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,575
But there is no "next time"

172
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,175
Frankenstein

173
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,175
I felt the sense of death today

174
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,725
Master

175
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,150
Fight in a small box

176
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,675
Extremely tragic

177
00:14:30,675 --> 00:14:32,400
So it's just a game

178
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,150
But how to say

179
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,550
Frankenstein. I'm here

180
00:14:39,325 --> 00:14:42,500
School is not a terrible place

181
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,025
That's fantastic

182
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:48,850
Excuse me

183
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:55,275
This is…

184
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,325
Yu -Tashiro

185
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,200
Did you hear that?

186
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,575
Contacted

187
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:15,775
Just wait now

188
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:22,125
Are you hungry

189
00:15:23,675 --> 00:15:25,825
The remaining kid is also here too

190
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,575
Do whatever you want

191
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,950
Wait. If his friend didn't come

192
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,825
we have to find him

193
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,975
It doesn't matter

194
00:15:35,975 --> 00:15:37,675
Just eat when you want

195
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,725
Hurry up and run away -Yu

196
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,025
What's going on? M24 What happened?

197
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,525
That strange text message just now

198
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,800
Those kids may be in danger

199
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:16,375
Crap is still crap after all

200
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:24,875
It can't be helped

201
00:16:25,075 --> 00:16:27,100
Come and play hide and seek

202
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,650
It's the elevator

203
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:38,825
Move quickly, please

204
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:40,675
Damn it

205
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:41,900
I'm here

206
00:16:56,925 --> 00:16:58,875
Found you

207
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,650
No

208
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,075
What?

209
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,100
It's great

210
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,775
Tashiro

211
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,825
Stop!

212
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,900
Then it's your turn

213
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,625
Stop

214
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,350
I can't

215
00:17:53,275 --> 00:17:54,800
I won't let you hit my friends

216
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,500
I won't let you hit my friends

217
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:06,600
Be sure next time…

218
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,475
Stop

219
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:12,050
I won't let you hit my partners

220
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,350
I won't let you hit my partners

221
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:17,375
Stop

222
00:18:21,075 --> 00:18:22,300
Stop

223
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,025
Stop

224
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,525
Stop. Stop

225
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,300
Stop. Stop

226
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,075
Stop. Stop

227
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,975
Stop!

228
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:46,275
Damn it

229
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,450
I didn't hold back.

230
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,550
Tashiro -Yu

231
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,575
Why, man?

232
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:56,750
Who knows

233
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,500
I just can't stand

234
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,375
Seeing my friend getting hurt

235
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,150
I'm sorry

236
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,175
What happened? Answer me

237
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,775
Shouldn't it...

238
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:19,775
Sure enough you betrayed it

239
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:25,875
The organization has known your intentions a long time ago

240
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:30,625
Our task is to recycle the coffin and…

241
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,525
To punish you

242
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,075
Just wait for you to show your tail

243
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,275
We didn't expect you to endure till now

244
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,125
I'm sorry M21

245
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,775
You guy, this power is

246
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,075
M24

247
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,725
You still have time to look elsewhere

248
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,125
It seems we need to update your fighting capacity

249
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,100
But

250
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,725
But after all, you are just consumables for the organization

251
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,725
No, you are only failures at best

252
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,650
What?

253
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,875
What you said just now?

254
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,125
I don't like to hear it

255
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,375
Who?

256
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,550
Where are the kids?

257
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:16,125
It doesn't make any sense to tell you

258
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,400
I'm afraid they have been already dead

259
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:21,625
This sense of majesty

260
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,250
Who on earth is this man?

261
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,700
Although it's very unlikely

262
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,325
if it is these two men

263
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,925
they can create M24 a chance to escape

264
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:37,675
The kids are below

265
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,600
I will hold it here

266
00:21:40,025 --> 00:21:41,300
You guys go

267
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,075
I am definitely no match for her

268
00:21:44,475 --> 00:21:47,600
But in order to rescue M24

269
00:21:47,675 --> 00:21:49,025
I have to do it

270
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,675
Frankenstein, please deal with it here

271
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,275
Got it

272
00:21:55,725 --> 00:21:56,825
Please lead the way

273
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,575
What are  you saying?

274
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,750
It's impossible for one person to beat Mary

275
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,975
There is no time

276
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,425
Got it. This way

277
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,625
Never want to escape from here easily

278
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,950
Your opponent is me

279
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:31,600
Is that the best you can do at the risk of your life?

280
00:22:33,525 --> 00:22:35,025
Keep you waiting so long

281
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,550
Stop, Tashiro

282
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,975
What can you do

283
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:50,150
I'm asking what you can do

284
00:22:57,675 --> 00:22:58,875
Lai

285
00:23:00,975 --> 00:23:02,400
is it you?

286
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,425
That remaining witness

287
00:23:07,325 --> 00:23:09,300
Jack!!

288
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:16,975
So fast

289
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:19,175
My attack failed to hit him

290
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,850
I admit you are powerful

291
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,825
I haven't shown like this for a long time

292
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,175
It's not the same as before

293
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,175
Where is M24?

294
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,575
He was still begging me for mercy before he died

295
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,600
You jerk

296
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:15,000
You and I are not at the same level after all

297
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,375
What's that look in your eyes

298
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:45,350
Where's all that confidence?

299
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm asking what's that look in your eyes

300
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,000
Frankenstein -Master

301
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,700
Has mankind advanced so far?

302
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,300
I allow you to remove your seal

303
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:12,400
In the name of the Lord·Cadiz·Aitrama·di·Legero

304
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:17,050
Kill the enemy in front of you

305
00:25:17,775 --> 00:25:19,300
Yes, master

306
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:30,225
What's this power

307
00:25:30,425 --> 00:25:33,225
Won't the wound on the arm heal?

308
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,125
At first it was just a suspicion, but now it seems right

309
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:44,275
You're all here because of me

310
00:25:45,825 --> 00:25:47,375
What's the meaning?

311
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:50,000
Stop the gossip

312
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,650
Disappear

313
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:19,200
Did you come here to see how your partner was killed?

314
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,450
Lai

315
00:26:21,475 --> 00:26:22,950
Hurry up and run away

316
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:26,725
Then let you die first

317
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,325
Are you scared to look directly?

318
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:34,450
Look directly?

319
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,150
What are you saying?

320
00:26:39,825 --> 00:26:41,275
Kneel down

321
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,900
This is the height of sighting line that should have been

322
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,925
Does it control the body and mind

323
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,525
Damn it. You guy

324
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,850
Is this guy

325
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,700
we are looking for?

326
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,550
The Great Nobility

327
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,975
Don't be in your glory

328
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:45,650
I am in the apex of all living things

329
00:27:46,025 --> 00:27:49,150
Totally different from you

330
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,300
To be killed by me like this

331
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,750
You should be honored

332
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:56,825
You are talkative

333
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,975
Don't you guys know the current situation?

334
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,700
Go to hell

335
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,300
Kneel down

336
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,650
Lai

337
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,325
Damn it

338
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,250
Why?

339
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,925
The sin you committed

340
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,825
What's this?

341
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,425
Just bury it with you blood

342
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,125
Help

343
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,925
