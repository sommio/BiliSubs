1
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,940
These are shells from two kinds of shellfish: snails and bivalves.

2
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,900
Clams, scallops and mussels are bivalves.

3
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,740
The conch and turban shells are from snails.

4
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,320
Whoa...

5
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,440
Inside the shell, their bodies are very soft, which is why they’re also called molluscs.

6
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,640
So that’s why they use a hard shell to protect themselves.

7
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,400
Oh! Now that I think of it...

8
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,100
Hm?

9
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,880
Escargon has a shell too!

10
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,800
...Right. Snails are a type of shellfish that went onto land.

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,100
So that guy’s nothing but a shellfish, huh.

12
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,260
Someone must be gossiping about me...

13
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,660
Forget about potential slander, come give this a taste.

14
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,160
Boy, grilled turban shell is the best!

15
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,960
Don’t be shy, come on.

16
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,960
I don’t want that sort of thing.

17
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,480
Why’s that?

18
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,600
I just don’t like it.

19
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,140
Not even with the smell of cooking soy sauce…

20
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,060
Here, try.

21
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,740
Hmph!

22
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,840
You’re a weird guy if you don’t like this stuff.

23
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,480
Soldiers, clean up those shells.

24
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,520
Hm? A shell?

25
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,200
Speaking of shells...

26
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,780
Don’t you gotta shell like that?!

27
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,670
...shell like that… shell like that...

28
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,120
Escargon Exposed

29
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,180
Wait! Escargon!

30
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,260
I just want to take a closer look at you!

31
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,860
That’s exactly what I don’t want!

32
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,480
Why are you being so stubborn about this?!

33
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,380
Why you little…!

34
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,380
You’ll never hit me with hammer skills like th- whoa!

35
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,860
Hehe, over here!

36
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,420
Stop being so shellfish!!

37
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,920
Looks like they’re fighting again.

38
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,680
Are those two on good terms or not?

39
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,640
They get along fine when they’re doing something bad, yet they fight over all sorts of trivial things.

40
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,320
Let’s go get a snack, Kirby.

41
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,040
Snack!

42
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,240
Can’t catch meee!

43
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,940
Too light on my feet.

44
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,820
Nyeeh!

45
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,840
Wait!

46
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,000
The years are catching up to you, Your Majesty.

47
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,600
Now if you’ll excuse me.

48
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,860
Dropped your guard!

49
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,140
That’s not fair!

50
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,380
Your blunder was turning your back on your enemy.

51
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,900
It’s starting to crack here.

52
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,080
A crack?! I can’t see.

53
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,840
Well well, so you’re really a shellfish after all?

54
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,460
That answers that question!

55
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,620
Shellahahahahaha...

56
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,840
This is no laughing matter!

57
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,900
Oh I’m breaking out in a cold sweat..

58
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,680
Help!

59
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,160
What?!

60
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,260
Escargon?!

61
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,260
What’s wrong?

62
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,740
Please help! You have to get me to a hospital.

63
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,020
Hos’pal?

64
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,480
Well well… Ah, this is… I see...

65
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,100
H-How is it?

66
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,020
It’s perfect. There’s a splendid crack forming.

67
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,340
Huh?! Then fix it!

68
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,340
It’s going to split no matter what.

69
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,360
Haaa?!

70
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,920
There’s no chance of recovery.

71
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,060
Hahaa?!

72
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,240
It’s going to split more.

73
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,620
It what?!

74
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,180
Ah… eeh… I…

75
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,760
OH MY GOD!!

76
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,220
Escargon.

77
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,040
Do you have to make such a big deal over it?

78
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,260
My shell isn’t like your clothes- it’s like my spine!

79
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,980
Hey, Yabui! Escargon’s bound to be here!

80
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,920
Yabui! Are you here?

81
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,260
Escargon?

82
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,680
Hm?

83
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,680
That’s odd, Yabui, your door won’t open.

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,460
Open the door while I still feel like a nice chat.

85
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,840
I’m hospitalized with a severe illness
for the next 80 years, so leave me alone!

86
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,680
Oh Escargon that’s terrible.
That’s why I’ve come to visit.

87
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,500
Don’t you worry

88
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,000
Es… car… gon!

89
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,000
This is the worst experience of my life.

90
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,480
Escargon!

91
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,480
Oh, no!

92
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,660
Dedede! If Escargon’s shell cracks any more, he won’t be able to conceal himself!

93
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,560
Conceal himself?

94
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,660
If the shell comes off completely, Escargon would be naked.

95
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,260
Escargon would be naked?!

96
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,620
I’ve never thought about what’s inside Escargon’s shell before.

97
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,660
But it's gotta be absolutely fascinating!

98
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,280
I wanna see what your body’s like!

99
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,400
Nobody seriously cares about that, right?

100
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,300
Actually...

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,140
Augh I can’t trust any of you!

102
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,820
I’ll treat it for you! Open the door!

103
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,540
Eek! Don’t open it!

104
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,160
What are you being so shy for?!

105
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,280
Me and you are friends!

106
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,960
Don't clam up!

107
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,580
Come out of your shell a bit!

108
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,540
Just leave... me... alone!

109
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,480
...a little help?!

110
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,660
I’ll have to use force!

111
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,300
It cracked...

112
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,920
Aw, it closed up. Get off there, Kirby.

113
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,240
Kirby, don’t move!

114
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,340
Don’t you see what you’ve done?
Now it’s cracked completely!

115
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,880
Demon! Ogre! Brute! Fatso! Sadist!

116
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,420
Don’t get mad, just let me check your injuries.

117
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,460
Don’t look at me...

118
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,420
You saying that only makes me want a better look.

119
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,900
Noooo don’t look!

120
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,840
Show me!                     No!

121
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,160
Get away!                         If you show me!!

122
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,320
Stop!                       When you show me!

123
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,860
We have the sort of relationship where we washed each other’s backs in the hot springs last autumn!

124
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,200
Oh wow!

125
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,400
Oh no!

126
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,240
Oh yay…

127
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,580
Po-yay?

128
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,100
That’s enough!

129
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,880
Dedede, you have to repay Escargon for his shell.

130
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,460
Re...pay? Replay? Relay?

131
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,940
It means make up for the damages! Find a way to restore his shell!

132
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,860
You hear that?!

133
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,120
You want to change your shell?

134
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,900
Alright, I got just the thing!

135
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,740
If it isn’t His Majesty. How can I help you today?

136
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,960
Escargon’s shell broke completely in half!

137
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,960
His shell was broken?

138
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,760
Then His Excellency has regressed to a mere slug?

139
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,280
I don’t know what he is, but I’m ordering a replacement shell!

140
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,600
Understood.

141
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,320
However, as this is a custom order, the cost and time needed will be higher.

142
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,500
It can be as late and expensive as you want as long as I get to have plenty of fun in the meantime.

143
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,420
Done.

144
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,880
Whew, it all turned out okay...

145
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,840
But look here, you all!

146
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,220
I’m afraid of moving with this packing tape on me!

147
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,720
We wrapped it with plenty so it should be
okay even if you move around a lot.

148
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,200
This is just a stop-gap measure!

149
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,600
Yabui! You’re a doctor, so isn’t it your job to do something to fix me?

150
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,880
I don’t know anything about molluscs, they disgust me.

151
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,040
Maybe if we use a really strong glue?

152
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,460
That’ll have to do.

153
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,440
But won’t you have to remove the shell to apply the adhesive?

154
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,540
No way?!

155
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,520
So basically like a change of clothes?

156
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,580
Let’s all split up and find a new shell he can change into.

157
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,140
This jar is from an ancient Pupupu civilization...

158
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,860
I don’t even care if it’s fake, I just need to borrow a bigger jar!

159
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,480
Bigger…?

160
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,440
Just borrowing this for a bit!

161
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,920
Stop! I need that for my business!

162
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,040
Oh?

163
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,460
And what are you using wool for?

164
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,920
That’s a secret.
A big secret!

165
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,860
Hey now, that isn’t something you can eat.

166
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,500
That’s just an empty shell.

167
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,320
Oh boy….

168
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,740
A vase, a pot, a tub and some wool.

169
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,560
These are supposed to be my shell for the time being?

170
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,800
Pick the one you like.

171
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,860
One I like…  Right, of course, how could I ever choose...

172
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,460
..from this kind of GARBAGE!? Ugh!

173
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,880
What about that way, Bun?

174
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,080
All clear!

175
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,420
Nothing out of the ordinary here, Fumu.

176
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,140
If his Majesty is such a stalker, I wonder how far he’d go?

177
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,660
If he wants to see him, he’ll do whatever it takes.

178
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,220
Escargon, the coast is clear.

179
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,000
I’m counting on you?

180
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,500
Whatever you do, don’t peek!

181
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,320
Yeah yeah.

182
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,520
Did Escargon take it off yet? Did he?

183
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,700
Shut up! If you peek I’ll never forgive you!

184
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,720
If I want to see, I really will do whatever it takes.

185
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,360
Really, what did I do to deserve this…

186
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,460
Well let’s start with the tub.

187
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,460
Oh, that’s good!!

188
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,440
Yeah, take it off!!

189
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,220
What the hell are you?!!

190
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,380
It was destroyed! My raging desire for knowledge has been trampled!

191
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,940
Are you okay, Escargon?

192
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,100
Eeeeek!

193
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,060
Sorry….

194
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,060
This is a bit much.

195
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,820
I’ll just have to try them all on!

196
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,260
A pot!

197
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,320
So weird...

198
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,760
A sheep’s wool! Baaah! So cute!

199
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,040
Even weirder!

200
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,500
Pupupu jar!

201
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
So old fashioned!

202
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,980
This is tragic!

203
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,240
How goes it, Fumu?

204
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,420
Does the glue work?

205
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,000
It’s tricky.  But it’s certainly interesting inside.

206
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,900
It is?

207
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,100
I wonder how he can get a shell like this to wear.

208
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,140
I may not be Dedede, but I’d still like to see how Escargon’s body works.

209
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,960
A snail without a shell is a slug.

210
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,760
That means, right now His Excellency Escargon is...

211
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,160
His Excellency, Slugscargon!

212
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,900
Don’t make light of my personal issues!
I’ll make sure you pay for this! Don’t laugh!

213
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,760
Oh, this one…!

214
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,140
This one looks like a perfect fit. You’re the only one who understands me, Kirby.

215
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,720
Now for what you’ve all been waiting for!

216
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,940
Ta-dah!

217
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,880
It really suits you!

218
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,740
Well, it is the same kind of shell.

219
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,000
Just be patient a while longer.

220
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,960
Nevertheless…

221
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,040
...stop standing around gawking, and get my shell fixed, pronto!

222
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,140
Got it?

223
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,400
Ugh. He’s so ungrateful.

224
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,480
Let’s just hurry and get it done.

225
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,480
To tell the truth, this is actually pretty nice.

226
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,020
Escargon! Escargon!

227
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,720
Eep! Not good...

228
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,080
Where are you?
Eep! Not good...

229
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,680
Where are you?

230
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,180
What’s this?

231
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,240
This should be plenty strong enough...

232
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,760
Hey, there’s something inside.

233
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,140
Hey Waddle Dee, go set up the courtyard!

234
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,680
There. Looks like it’s holding together.

235
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,140
We should still be careful with it.

236
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,640
And here you have molluscs going their whole lives carrying one of these...

237
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,040
Poor things…

238
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,760
What is that delicious aroma?

239
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,260
There’s no way… It’s getting hot, I can’t breathe...

240
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,220
That olive oil, butter and garlic smell so good cooking together.

241
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,980
Your Majesty, that’s a splendid turban shell.

242
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,420
It smells delicious!

243
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,400
Grilled turban shell is a real delicacy. Since it’s so big I might share with you.

244
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,040
It’s getting pretty hot in here somehow!

245
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,200
Whoa, wait a second!

246
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,140
Help!

247
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,700
Kirby, inhale it!

248
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,400
Stop that!

249
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,260
Oh! Escargon!

250
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,700
Stop inhaling!

251
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,840
Were you pretending to be a snail when you were pleasant Sazae-san all along?!
(see notes in description)

252
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,640
Don’t be ridiculous!

253
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,540
That’s just an empty turban shell. Escargon was just inside.

254
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,640
So that means…

255
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,020
Escargon! How dare you eat that pleasant Sazae-san before I could!!

256
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,400
Did not! It was empty before I put it on!

257
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,700
It was, huh?
What’s going on inside that shell?!

258
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,620
Uh oh!

259
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,300
I give up!!

260
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,200
What are you doing?!

261
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Escargon, don’t run away!

262
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,100
When it comes to my thirst for knowledge, I don’t know how to give up!

263
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,480
My age… is… catching up...

264
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,240
My age… is… catching up...

265
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,980
My my, if it isn’t His Excellency, Escargon.

266
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,880
That shell really suits you.

267
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,140
Even you! Laugh all you want!

268
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,560
I’m so sorry to have kept you waiting.

269
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,140
I’ll send your new shell, Your Excellency.

270
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,300
Escargon!

271
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,040
Oh no!

272
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,280
You in here?

273
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,880
Hey, Escargon.

274
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,560
It’s completely empty.

275
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,120
What took you?

276
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,280
What do you think of this?

277
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,540
Just a bit heavy...

278
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,560
This is Escargon’s new shell?

279
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,940
It’s our superalloy Heavy Metal Shell, mobile armored battle suit.

280
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,500
Enjoy yourselves.

281
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,260
Thanks!

282
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,480
Want to try your luck?

283
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,860
I have to know what you’re made of, no matter what.

284
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,220
Well if you really want to, give it a shot.

285
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,760
Here goes!!

286
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,060
Too hard...

287
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,860
Shell~

288
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
Shell shell...

289
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,820
Escargon, what have you...

290
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,520
That’s Maimaigon to you- shell.

291
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,880
Escargon’s…

292
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,800
...a demon beast!

293
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,720
Shell, shell!

294
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,700
You’re done for, Kirby.

295
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,440
That’s horrible, turning Escargon into a demon beast!

296
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,420
Fiend!

297
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,980
Begone!

298
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,220
Kirby! Inhale the hammer!

299
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,860
Got it!

300
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,300
Hammer Kirby!

301
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,200
Hammer Strike!

302
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,960
Oh that’s not working, what now?!

303
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,660
Hammer Strike!

304
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,380
Shell… Mai Mai Beam!

305
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,420
Giant Swing!

306
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,340
Mai Mai Beam!

307
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,900
Exploding…

308
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,580
Hammer Throw!

309
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,180
He did it!

310
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:50,660
Lemme see… Lemme see, lemme see!!

311
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,820
Good work, Kirby!

312
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,420
Where’s Escargon?

313
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,860
I couldn’t see after all.

314
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,220
Ta-dah!

315
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,020
Thanks to that strong adhesive...

316
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,500
It should last a lifetime.

317
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,380
So after all that, Escargon’s secret...

318
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,540
I guess we’ll never know.

319
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,140
Escargon! Let’s go to the hot springs together!

320
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,980
No way! I see right through your schemes!

321
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,660
Let’s get to know each other better!
No way! I see right through your schemes!

322
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,940
Let’s get to know each other better!

323
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,960
Don’t come near me! Don’t touch me! Stay back!

324
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,280
Just wait!
Don’t come near me! Don’t touch me! Stay back!

325
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,200
Just wait!

326
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,400
Nooo!!
Just wait!

327
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,080
Nooo!!

328
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,660
Let’s just ignore them.

329
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,700
