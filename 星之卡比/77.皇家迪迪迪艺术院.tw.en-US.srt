1
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,460
Good! It looks nice!

2
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,120
Look carefully. The shadows should be deeper.

3
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,940
Sometimes the shadows are more important than the lighting.

4
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,640
Okay.

5
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,560
How’s it going over here?

6
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,400
Great!

7
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,240
I can’t draw very well...

8
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,980
Don’t give up!

9
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,060
The more you observe things, the better your drawing skills will become.

10
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,480
Eh? What’s this?

11
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,980
Hmm… I got it! It’s candy, right?

12
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,420
I know you want to eat, but we’re doing sketching practice now.

13
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,540
Hmm… That’s some extremely suspicious behavior.

14
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,080
That pest Fumu is up to something.

15
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,560
I bet she’s plotting a way to humiliate you again, Your Majesty.

16
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,560
That’s it! She’s planning to expose how stupid and thoughtless the country’s ruler is,

17
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,240
and establish a democratic nation of freedom and equality!

18
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,620
Well that sounds splendid!

19
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,080
Ow...

20
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:49,340
As the great dictator, I must completely abolish any kind of anti-government campaign!

21
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,400
Ah, if it isn’t His Majesty.

22
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,700
Oh, carry on.

23
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,040
Mayor, you may continue working.

24
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,440
Working? It’s not like that...

25
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,880
Then what is it?

26
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,000
Uh, this is, well…
I’m thinking of painting that landscape...

27
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,280
Why not use a camera?

28
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,940
There wouldn’t be any meaning in that.

29
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,620
I think it’s something like this...

30
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,880
Your Majesty?

31
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,280
Please don’t look!

32
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,840
Are you doing things that you can’t have anyone peeking at?

33
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,000
No, nothing like that!

34
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,660
Then what?

35
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,660
I’m just trying to draw that tree…

36
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,660
You know, sketching.

37
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,760
Sketching?

38
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,320
What kind of an anti-government activity is sketching?

39
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,980
Anti-government…?

40
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,220
Oh.

41
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,120
Fumu! The main suspect of this treason has appeared!

42
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,120
I’ll arrest you if you make a fool of me!

43
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,680
No one’s going to make anything of you, so…

44
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,040
Here. If you have some free time, you could draw.

45
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,860
How are you going to commit anti-government activities with this?

46
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,920
Huh?

47
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,580
Your Majesty, that doesn’t seem to be the case.

48
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,020
You don’t need to be so suspicious of us.

49
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,840
Don’t you get it? Everyone’s drawing pictures.

50
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,440
Why would you do that?

51
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,260
Ugh!

52
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,360
They’re trying to create something that’s lacking in this village!

53
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,640
And that is ART!

54
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,080
...Art?

55
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,380
To feel a sense of beauty, and to develop an appreciation for beautiful things,

56
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,520
it’s important to practice drawing and sketching.

57
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,320
You hear that? They call it ‘’art’’...

58
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,640
So, where are the weapons?

59
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,040
Are you really sure about that?

60
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,700
Well, there’s going to be an exhibition soon. You’ll understand when you see it!

61
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,920
Th-That’s right!

62
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,160
Everyone! Our long-awaited art exhibition is now here!

63
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,920
The artworks that you all have been working on so diligently are just wonderful!

64
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,980
Now let’s begin admiring them right awa-

65
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,480
I have an announcement for you terrorists. Resistance is futile!

66
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,540
Throw down your weapons and disperse!

67
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,320
Oh my...

68
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,100
My art career’s a total wash...

69
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,840
This is an outrage!

70
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,960
Look at what you did to my artwork!

71
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,380
Why can’t you understand the meaning of art!?

72
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,140
After I worked so hard on it!

73
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,020
Now it’s all messed up!

74
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,340
This village doesn’t even have a little museum where people can enjoy paintings and sculptures!

75
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,300
That’s why we wanted to hold an exhibition here...

76
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,300
You can’t go doing things like this!

77
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,300
But, you know...

78
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,000
It would be strange if his Majesty understood art.

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,280
It’s impossible for Kirby and Dedede.

80
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,980
How about we leave those two be...

81
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,440
They lumped me in with Kirby.

82
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,960
Is that the lengths you’ll go to make fun of someone?

83
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,760
I can make a museum in an instant!

84
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,920
Soldiers!

85
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,980
How’s that for spacy and luxurious?

86
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,520
With this, we can endeavor to improve the people’s artistic culture…

87
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,240
The building is awfully big though...

88
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,280
What about inside?

89
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,540
There aren’t any paintings?

90
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,480
Typical of a box-based government to make a box but not think of the contents.

91
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
It’s something a witless bureaucrat would do.

92
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,360
What’d you say? I’m thinking about the contents now!

93
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,780
In that case, I have a suggestion.

94
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,520
Eh?

95
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,340
What if we all make all the paintings?

96
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,800
We’ll choose the best ones in a contest and hang them up here.

97
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,380
Sounds good!

98
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,540
So a painting competition?

99
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,000
All right! I’ll take first place!

100
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,720
I’ll give out prizes for the ones that make it to the top ten.

101
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,480
As expected from you, Your Majesty.

102
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,640
How generous!

103
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,180
Wait, you’re going to do it for the money?

104
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,540
If we can make money doing art...

105
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,600
That would be the greatest!

106
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Okay, I’ll do my best!

107
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,860
I’m gonna paint!

108
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,980
Wait, everyone!

109
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,380
We’ve finally fooled them.

110
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,060
Hanging up THEIR paintings would be a disgrace to the art world!

111
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,460
Huh? Famous paintings from around the world?

112
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,460
Not only first-class paintings, but sculptures too!

113
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,540
But works of art are expensive.

114
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,680
Just one can cost many hundreds of millions of deden. How about a painting demon beast instead…?

115
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,800
Are you trying to make me lose face?!

116
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,180
You’re always trying to palm off useless demon beasts!

117
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,000
Well, how about renting?

118
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Your Majesty, what do we do?

119
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,140
However, you must return them undamaged within three days.

120
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,580
Hurry up!

121
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,000
Listen, everyone! Why are you all painting for money?

122
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,660
Is there something wrong with that?

123
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,020
Because then it becomes a business!

124
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,900
Is being a business a bad thing?

125
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,120
Sis, give it up. Isn’t it good that everyone’s painting pictures?

126
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
But like this...

127
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:24,880
Participating applicants, leave your artwork over there and write down your names, addresses, ages and occupations!

128
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,520
Commoners, we don’t need your pictures anymore!

129
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,940
What?!

130
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,940
After I worked so hard on it?!

131
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,280
Since there are submissions from around the world- no, the universe- we’re going to look at those instead!

132
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,080
Fumu, since you know so much about art, you’ll be a judge and pick out the good ones!

133
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,780
Huh?

134
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,640
Now then, unveil the goods.

135
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,380
Let the alien art judging begin!

136
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,680
This is…!

137
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,940
This isn’t a creature from Pupupuland!

138
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,020
Of course not, this was made by aliens from somewhere!

139
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,820
I’ve never seen anything so weird looking!

140
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,120
This certainly was drawn by a lifeform that may have been different from us!

141
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,880
But it’s so lovely...!

142
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,700
This is true art!

143
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,740
Wha- what!?

144
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,480
Are you out of your mind!?

145
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,940
Let’s see the other ones too!

146
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,280
These guys are as ugly as Customer Service.

147
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,900
Each and every one of them is grotesque!

148
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,340
This kind of creepy art should be burned!

149
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,000
Don’t say stupid things.

150
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,300
They're all wonderful…

151
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,740
This must be greatest treasure in the universe!

152
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,460
We should show the villagers too!

153
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,460
What’re you saying? The commoners would die from sheer terror!

154
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,600
No they wouldn’t! You absolutely have to show this to the public! Right now!

155
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,500
Oh my, to think that we’ll be able to see paintings by people from a different planet...

156
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,320
I’d call that ground-breaking.

157
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,840
It’s unbelievable.

158
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,540
I’m glad I was born in such a good age!

159
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,820
Anyone who doesn’t see this may regret it for the rest of their lives!

160
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:56,640
Ladies and gentlemen! An astounding collection of alien art is now on display!

161
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,280
I’ve studied each of the works of art,

162
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,960
so I will be your guide in the art museum!

163
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,640
We’ll be able to admire the art with Miss Fumu as our guide!

164
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,780
Oh good!

165
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,720
Let’s begin with the sculptures.

166
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,620
So this is what aliens look like.

167
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,900
Yes. It’s made of stone, so the arms have broken.

168
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,200
But that only stimulates the imagination!

169
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,900
Doesn’t the body have such beautiful curves?

170
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,720
And this? Is he sitting on a toilet?

171
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,540
No, rather… he appears to be thinking about something.

172
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,340
They’re certainly different from us, these aliens.

173
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,700
In this picture, there is an established perspective.

174
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,380
Oh, perspective?

175
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,960
Please observe! Things that are far away and close are portrayed so realistically,

176
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,320
it’s as if you’re looking at a real building!

177
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,420
Well, this is truly amazing.

178
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,120
Its impressive.

179
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,020
The observation and representation of anatomy this painter has done is really excellent.

180
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,280
This painting on the ceiling looks like there’s a mythological story behind it.

181
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,220
Why aren’t there any ones that look like us?

182
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,400
I don’t understand any of this.

183
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,640
Oh, since when did they...

184
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,180
Now then, as the art techniques develop, you start to see more skill with detailed portrayals,

185
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,260
in-depth compositions, and depictions of light and shadow.

186
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,960
Have a look at this truly dramatic picture.

187
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,560
When historical events are depicted in paintings, they may have value as a record of what happened!

188
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,440
And from here we leave the events of mythology and history,

189
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,880
and move on to paintings with a natural scenery full of light that is all around us!

190
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,380
My, how lovely!

191
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,540
Not as lovely as you...

192
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,180
Many of the artworks decorating these walls here portray landscapes and people,

193
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,180
but a revolution in art style is present.

194
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,820
Look! Isn’t the depiction of light and shadow splendid when painted with many dots of color?

195
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,360
They tried to make a beautiful impression itself into a painting,

196
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,300
so I call it Impressionism!

197
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,240
How about some Kawasaki special sandwiches while you appreciate the art?

198
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,380
Anyone is welcome to hear my prediction of their artistic taste!

199
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,960
I wonder if I have any?

200
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,900
That’s too funny!

201
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,460
What is this stuff?

202
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,520
These are total crap!

203
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,440
Ah, I think these are attempts at breaking away from the usual way of seeing things.

204
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
But bad is still bad!

205
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,340
Yay, those look funny!

206
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,980
These are attempts to overturn the accepted way of making art,

207
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,520
and give a new meaning to advertising and the everyday life we’re used to.

208
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,900
What is this?

209
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,980
That’s confusing..

210
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,980
But it looks fun!

211
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:32,040
Instead of drawing anything specific, these are attempts to understand what art itself really is.

212
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,960
I see, looking at it, that might be true-

213
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,600
Ah, ouch...

214
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,780
What’s there to admire?! Even I could made this kind of art!

215
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,240
Your Majesty, when did you...

216
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,060
Now, you’ll see MY art!

217
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,540
This is the special exhibition room for my art!

218
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:05,280
This is me! I’m the big star, therefore I’m drawn big and cute right in the middle.

219
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,260
Instead of bothering with perspective, I drew it while wearing bifocals.

220
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,740
Here’s my castle, and a pooping Escargon.

221
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,580
Here’s the mayor and his sheep.

222
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:23,980
This is Kirby, who’s pooping after eating too much. Realism at its finest!

223
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,280
I can’t determine if it’s art or not...

224
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,760
It’s too ridiculous...

225
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,300
I’m gonna die laughing…

226
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,720
Are you laughing at my art!?

227
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,560
Ah, Your Majesty...

228
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,480
Anyone laughing gets a 10,000 year sentence with torture. and that's me showing mercy!

229
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,020
Send me a real artist!

230
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,660
We’re all out of artists, but I can give you a demon beast...

231
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,960
Anything that can draw pictures is fine!

232
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,400
What’s that guy?

233
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,380
The Drawing Demon Beast, Paint Roller.

234
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,680
He will paint a picture of anything you command.

235
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,660
Alright, change all of the alien art into my style right away!

236
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,860
Ahh, stop it!

237
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,440
Capture him!

238
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,740
I can forgive a little creative license!

239
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,400
If the stuff we borrowed looks like this, we’ll be charged for damaging them!

240
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,880
You fool! This is shameless!  Is this some big joke, you dolt?

241
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,520
Since your only crime was painting me, I’ll forgive you in exchange for painting my beautiful portrait!

242
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,740
Oh, what a disaster...

243
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,900
It’s ruined!

244
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,400
We have to fix it somehow...

245
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,480
It’s alive! The painting came to life!

246
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,940
Speaking of that, sis, that guy is painting Dedede right now!

247
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,800
That means...!

248
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,660
Is it ready?

249
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,160
I’m ready.

250
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,280
Wha-what!?

251
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,200
I’m the ruler!

252
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,240
Wha!?

253
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,700
Your Majesty, over here!

254
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,380
Dedede!

255
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,740
My own portrait turned on me!

256
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,300
That’s because you used a demon beast!

257
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,720
It’s going after Kirby!

258
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,620
The true enemy is Paint Roller!

259
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,520
Paint…?

260
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,160
Its paintings become real! If it paints something dangerous...

261
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,420
Oh no!

262
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,700
Kirby, inhale!

263
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,480
Yes, it’s Paint Kirby!

264
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,120
This is bad! Everyone, run!

265
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,140
Kirby!

266
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,900
You did it!

267
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,260
We’re going to have to pay for the damages again...

268
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,000
Look! Now this is art!

269
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,320
Escargon.

270
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:42,620
Huh?

271
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,740
What are you building?

272
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,340
It’s a secret! Just go away, geez!

273
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,180
What are you so angry about!?

274
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,420
Isn’t it obvious!? It’s his Majesty!

275
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,860
Even though I hate working, he’s always telling me to ‘’do this, do that’"!

276
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,480
Seriously, he really pushes people too hard!

277
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,740
Maybe ‘cause you work at a snail’s pace?

278
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:02,780
Shut up! Even for you and Kirby, the next one should be huge!
